# D367: 30 fps on real hardware, three-room route

## 2026-10-10: r117, the chapter 2-1 end (ROUTE_CH21, lane r117)

- r118 door 4 -> r117 -> s00 (Ashley) -> s10 (Saddler) -> "End of Chapter 2-1" + Save (route doc "r117"). Ashley
  (pl11) is a room overlay; em11 ships prepared (motion leases). CH21 discs now play their streams: aica_str.dat
  has 17 entries and the player read 16. H2 + bell STRICT, MUST-IDENTICAL; s30 heap_before 61,600 (floor 57,504).
  Next: chapter 2-2 (r118 part 1 -> r112 -> r111 -> r113 -> r11c).

## 2026-10-10: r118 past El Gigante (ROUTE_CH21, lane r118)

- r119 door 0 -> r118 -> back, and r118's r117 door shows "Coming Soon" (route doc "r118"). Code is the r118 BGM0
  slot (snd.cpp, CH21) + aica_banks + warp presets; the rest is staged data. HALT 0, MISSING 0. Next: r117.

## 2026-10-10: ACTOR_EXACT_FAST, r119 exact-lit trees (lane r118)

- Render only, default 1 with ROUTE_CH21 (route doc "ACTOR_EXACT_FAST"): r119 quiet 109.3 -> 93.8 hw ms drawn;
  boss 88.0 -> 89.5 (unchanged: the giant is GC-drawn, next item). H2 + bell STRICT, MUST-IDENTICAL.

## 2026-10-10: LINK_TIGHT + LINK_OVL_HELPERS, heap margin for CH21 (lane r118)

- Link-only, default 1 with ROUTE_CH21 (route doc "LINK_TIGHT"): the KOS script's empty icache-aligned .sub0..9
  padding is gone and single-overlay helpers move into their room overlay. Trace `_end` -9.4 KB, play -12.3 KB;
  s30 heap_before 57,504 -> 65,696. MOVIE_FENCE_RETRY (timing only) keeps a not-ready fence from ending a movie.
  H2 + bell STRICT, MUST-IDENTICAL; New Game, r10b, r11b, r11a, r119 play through.

## 2026-10-10: r119, El Gigante (ROUTE_CH21, lane r119)

- r119 plays from r11a door 0 through s00 / s10 / s20 / s30 (PS2 movies) to the giant's death; exits to r118 / r10e
  show "Coming Soon" (route doc "r119"). em2b is a room overlay; its archive fits heap 4 only prepared (textures to
  native packages + motion leases: 4.79 MB -> 2.26 MB body; r119's largest free cell is 2.77 MB).
- r119 hw ms (cost arm, drawn / skipped): quiet 112.0 / 7.3, boss 90.6 / 11.7; RENDER dominates (source-drawn room
  models 59 ms in the quiet view). Flycast p50 72.1 / 62.6. Gates on d74b8ec8: H2 + bell STRICT / MUST-IDENTICAL,
  s30 heap_before 57,504 = control (the CH21 trace image is page-tight: keep r119.cpp lean).

## 2026-10-10: WATER42_GRID_SKIP, r10a / r11a lake water (ROUTE_CH13 block, lane fix21)

- espgen42 keeps only its water plane (the only thing logic reads: GetWaterHeight / GetWaterCrossPos /
  AddWaterPower bounds); the GX-only height grid and its per-frame update are skipped, init RNG draws kept. It runs in
  r10a and r11a only (scan of every effect record on GC disc 1). STRICT in r11a (three views) and r10a; H2 / bell
  STRICT, MUST-IDENTICAL; s30 heap_before 65,696 >= 57,504. Route doc "WATER42_GRID_SKIP".
- r11a hw ms: quiet 58.8 -> 41.2 drawn work (LOGIC 29.3 -> 16.4; now under the 30 fps cap), Ganados 68.1 -> 49.3
  drawn (LOGIC 34.3 -> 14.1). Flycast p50 36.2 -> 27.2 (29.9 fps), 42.1 -> 35.1.

## 2026-10-10: r11a, chapter 2-1 (ROUTE_CH21 image unchanged, lane r11a)

- r11a plays from r11b door 0; door 0 to r119 shows "Coming Soon" (route doc "r11a"). It is data only: the room
  container, the PS2 world, textures, and the AICA room bank (em24 added). The image is unchanged.
- r11a hw ms (cost arm, drawn / skipped): quiet 58.8 / 39.0, Ganados 68.1 / 37.0. LOGIC is ~27 ms in both, ~18 of
  it from espgen42's water grid. Flycast p50 36.2 / 42.1. Next perf item: an espgen42 grid skip (WATER45 pattern,
  needs its own audit + STRICT).

## 2026-10-10: r11b, chapter 2-1's start (ROUTE_CH21, lane r11b)

- r11b plays from the r10b door 6 transition (after the chapter 1-3 save); r11a / r10c / r10d show "Coming Soon"
  (route doc "r11b"). em22 (wolves) is a heap-4 room overlay; `_end` in the same 4 KiB page as 67fda5c8; H2 and bell
  STRICT / MUST-IDENTICAL; s30 heap_before 57,504 = control.
- r11b hw ms (cost arm, drawn): landing 40.0, wolf ambush 81.6 (LOGIC 12.5, RENDER 49.6). Flycast p50 34.4 / 50.5.

## 2026-10-10: r10b to chapter 1-3's end (ROUTE_CH13, lane r10b)

- r10b plays to SceSetChapterEnd(CHAPTER_1_3, 6) and "Coming Soon" at door 6 (route doc "r10b"). The boat (pl0f) and
  Del Lago (em2f) are heap-4 room overlays (ROUTE_OVL): the resident image is no larger than 19f62e62's (`_end` in
  the same 4 KiB page; s30 heap_before 57,504 = control). H2 and bell STRICT / MUST-IDENTICAL against 19f62e62.
- r10b hw ms (cost arm, drawn): dock 127.9 -> 61.3, lake 63.3 -> 60.2, boss pass (Del Lago within 2 m, frame ~4139) 42.6 -> 39.5. Two fixes: the em27 fish
  NaN (raw slot math read an unbacked sparse slot) and espgen45's GX-only height grid skipped (no RNG; STRICT pair).

## 2026-10-09: PACE_CAP=2 measured against the play recipe (decision pending)

The user asked to revisit PACE_CAP=2 now that the logic lane found no exact speedups left. The play default stays
PACE_CAP=1 (Fast). Evidence: D:/Flycast-Evidence/re4-dreamcast/pace2-20261009; review sheet and strip charts:
C:/Game Dev/Emulators/pace2-review.

- What it does (pace.cpp/pace.mk, compile time only): logic keeps the 29.97 Hz vblank clock in every setting. When
  the game is at least one tick (2 vblanks) behind, an iteration runs its whole logic tick with the image dropped
  (v2: no model OT, no present). PACE_CAP is the most consecutive dropped images: 1 = up to 2 ticks per drawn frame,
  2 = up to 3. Fast mode only takes the second drop (Smooth's 15 fps floor blocks it; Off disables pacing). Below
  real time either way the game runs in slow motion: speed = ticks per second / 29.97. No runtime or Options
  selection exists; RE4DCCFG stores only the mode (2 bits, all used).
- hw model on the 19f62e62 recipe (cost arms PACE_FORCE=2 and PACE_FORCE=T, stride 7), console factor 1.155
  outdoors (world submitted) and 1.03 indoors, replayed through the pacing rule (tools/d367/pacesim.py):

  | view (window) | model ms drawn / skipped | PACE_CAP=1 speed / fps | PACE_CAP=2 speed / fps |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | r101 square fight, worst view, ACT_CAP=0 (1330:1409) | 71.10 / 25.20 | 60% / 9.0 | 71% / 7.1 |
  | r100 house fight (2300:2379) | 54.30 / 22.33 | 75% / 11.3 | 88% / 8.8 |
  | r100 quiet outdoor (1240:1319) | 39.47 / 11.68 | 100% / 18.6 | 100% / 18.6 |
  | r100 house interior, quiet (800:879) | 38.33 / 12.35 | 100% / 23.1 | 100% / 23.1 |

  A second consecutive skip costs what a first does (D S S arm: square 25.04, fight 21.43). Input latency (pad read
  to the image showing it): square 105 -> 120 ms mean, fight 84 -> 97. Views already at 100% are unchanged.
- Logic STRICT (Flycast, ACT_CAP=0, trace builds of the recipe):
  - bell: PACE_CAP=2 Fast vs the unpaced control route-ti-bellB: whole room STRICT, decision_cmp MUST-IDENTICAL
    (5,102 ticks; Flycast ran the fight in the saturated D S S pattern throughout).
  - H2: PACE_CAP=2 Fast vs the unpaced control: STRICT to 740. The r100s03 movie (ticks 741..) ends on wall time,
    and any paced arm reaches its end at a different tick (control 1217, PACE_CAP=1 Fast 1216, PACE_CAP=2 Fast
    1215); the padscript and Frame_cnt-scheduled work then fall on other ticks, so the later windows differ, as for
    any timing change.
  - Equalised pair: PACE_CAP=1 vs PACE_CAP=2, both Fast with PACE_TEST_DRAW_US=40000 (the same emulated draw load,
    so the movie ends at tick 1213 in both and the r101 load completes at 180 in both): H2 STRICT 1450..1569 /
    ..740 / 1218.., whole room STRICT, decision_cmp MUST-IDENTICAL (5,808 ticks); bell whole room STRICT,
    MUST-IDENTICAL (4,374). One arm drew D S, the other D S S.
- Flycast (vsync off) does not reproduce hardware pacing: its vblanks outrun the guest timer, so even the unpaced
  control shows 58% speed at 29 ms of work. Its PACE windows only confirm the direction (H2 tail: CAP 1 69%
  13.1 fps, CAP 2 81% 8.0 fps).
- A runtime choice (a fourth "Fast+" value) would need: the cap as a variable in pace.cpp (want_skip, the
  lag-drop limit, kKeepVb), a third RE4DCCFG pacing bit, the chord and quality.txt values. The in-game Options row
  itself is still unbuilt.

## 2026-10-09: issue 9 diagnostics and issue 15 audio (test build)

- Issue 9 (bridge presentation hang on hardware): the first-failure snapshot
  also latches ASIC_ACK_A/B/C and TA_OPB_INIT, printed as one `asic` line on
  the stop screen (render-done lost vs ISP/TA overflow). Failure path only;
  `_end` +32 B in the same 4 KiB page, arena and s30 heap unchanged.
- Issue 15 (crushed audio): disc streams are decoded with the SND_SHD
  coefficient order (STREAM_VERSION 3). Clipped samples in the staged
  aica_str.dat: 0:2 763,211 -> 11, 0:8 1,177,151 -> 2, 1:3 80,601 -> 0,
  1:14 216,988 -> 2, 1:140 163,020 -> 0, 1:141 88,322 -> 0, 1:152 71,647 -> 0.
- Prebuilt banks use an anti-alias decimator (aica_banks.py decimate_aa,
  Kaiser sinc, FILTER_VERSION 2; loops filtered circularly). Same sizes,
  headers and layout; the runtime converter is unchanged. Banks on the disc:
  1,579 -> 2,730 clipped of 16.0 M samples (sinc keeps peaks the box average
  flattened). Existing discs are refiltered with `aica_banks.py reconvert`.
- TA_GUARD=1 was not used: it skips parts once the TA estimate passes its
  reserve (drawing changes) and is rejected with COARSE_ONE_SUBMIT=1. The
  ASIC ACK line already shows TA/ISP overflow bits without it.
- Gates (Flycast, ACT_CAP=0): H2 STRICT 1450..1569 / ..740 / 1218.., bell
  STRICT, decision_cmp MUST-IDENTICAL; s30 340/340 at heap_before 55,392 with
  calls 1:141 and 1:152 played and backing restored; New Game 1971/2360/1175;
  cold Load inventory set (Combine, Examine, rotation, three exact restores).
  Play disc payloads equal the 631cb271 disc except 1ST_READ.BIN, sscrn.ovl,
  aica_str.dat and the 39 bank files. Physical console results pending.

## 2026-10-08: hanging lamp fire and combined manual candidate

Admit source lamp effect owner 0x5e through the native sprite filter, preserving
all other restrictions. Flame/smoke are visible in the matched r102 source-hit
fixture; 2,795 source records are STRICT and required decisions match. Hardware
model drawn frames 430/432 cost +2.137605 ms at 200 MHz; existing resident-only
and sprite-cap limits still apply. This is not a console FPS measurement.
The combined raw GDI passes cold Load, visible Leon, 39-second Yellow Herb
Examine, exact 3 MiB restoration and movement. Console acceptance, bridge
timeout and herb appearance remain open. No binary publication or SD change.
See [lamp qualification](D367_LAMP_FIRE_20261008.md) for exact scope and builds.

## 2026-10-08: inventory retained-storage lifetime

The supplied-save cold-load failure is reproduced and corrected by detaching
the existing renderer cache borrow before inventory reuses the room window.
Green and Yellow Herb examinations, repeated exact 3 MiB restoration, visible
Leon and subsequent movement pass in Flycast. Matched current-recipe uncapped
village and house gates are STRICT (4,079 and 3,234 records), with required
decisions identical and house movie/radio resources preserved. No hardware
frame-time improvement or physical-console acceptance is claimed. The bridge
timeout and missing lamp fire remain separate work. See the
[inventory qualification](D367_INVENTORY_RETENTION_20261008.md).


## 2026-10-07: native Ganado prelit lighting and missing beam

The user reconfirmed Leon's baked-lighting performance choice and requested the
same path for Ganados. The play recipe now sets ACTOR_GANADO_SOURCE_LIGHT=0;
native Ganados use Leon's existing prelit/constant record. NATIVE_LASER=1 also
restores the missing source weapon beam through the existing effect queue;
target/dot/collision are unchanged. Both changes pass complete 2,911-record
STRICT and required-decision comparisons in the matched aim fixture.

The final 512-entry movie/radio gate completes s03/s20/s30, with s30 340/340 at
63,584 starting heap bytes and both radio backing hashes restored. Clean final
text +1,120 and character data -32 bytes leave BSS, allocated addresses, linked
end and arena unchanged. The Ganado wall-aim balanced model sample improves
48.350586 -> 47.786288 ms; this small local four-tick result is not console FPS.
See [the source bug qualification](D367_BUG_QUALIFICATION_20261007.md) for build
identities, modes, scope and preserved aborted attempts. No new release or SD
write follows. Inventory/bridge console failures remain un-reproduced and open;
reduced-distance fog and baked Leon are intentional user choices. The outdoor
candidate below remains unaccepted.

## 2026-10-07: outdoor follow-up remains unaccepted

The bounded current-Trans eligibility guard saves 0.699766 modeled ms of
synchronous owner work per drawn r101 square sample. Host checks, cold-cache
interior/checker runs, complete STRICT Bell (6,370)/H2 (3,237), ordinary radio resources
and final automated New Game pass. Clean ON adds 64 text bytes without linked-end
or arena growth. Final exact rendering qualification remains REVIEW_REQUIRED:
493 movie-only TA hash differences and held framebuffer pixel differences 0/8
and 5/0. Their cause is unproven; no new exclusions or thresholds are accepted.
The guard and observer stay private/off. No runtime/recipe/play-disc/SD/release
change follows. See [the final qualification](D367_OUTDOOR_PERF_20261007.md).
The larger outdoor 30 fps gap remains open; the remaining-stage and Leon donor
audits establish no additional authorized implementation.

## 2026-10-07: collision capacity accepted; visibility extension rejected

GAME_ATLIST_512=1 joins the play recipe. Enlarging only the existing two alive
arrays admits the 470-object cabinet list without changing the 96-collidable
limit or collision order. The balanced eight-tick cabinet sample improves
39.832->36.338 modeled ms; drawn 53.062->50.376 and skipped 26.592->22.288.
The longer census changes from 16/16 to 17/15 draw/skip; this is a bounded local
sample, not console FPS. Actual 470..479-object check mode reports no mismatch.

Bell passes 6,370 shared logic/required-decision records. H2's preserved-memory,
timing-controlled diagnostic passes all 3,237 shared records, retaining the
ordinary borrowed-memory and zero-delay timing failures separately. The normal
build has no diagnostic delay. Static data +1,536 bytes crosses an ARENA_FIT
page boundary, costing 4 KiB of measured arena/heap; s30 still plays 340/340 at
63,584 bytes and radio backing restores fully. See the play checklist and
[detailed evidence](D367_ATLIST_CAPACITY_20261007.md).

The guarded r104 world-cell experiment was rejected after 39.832->40.461 ms;
its runtime stays private. Leon qualification is complete: the combined path
fails required allocations and H2 gameplay despite a modest square gain;
face-only has a weak derived net gain and is also left off. See
[D367_LEON_REQUALIFICATION_20261007.md](D367_LEON_REQUALIFICATION_20261007.md).
Final capacity-only New Game completes all 1,971/2,360/1,175 movie frames and
reaches live r100 with no required allocation failures. The play checklist
records diagnostic scope and the separately verified clean local CUE/GDI.
Published r22j and SD folder154 are unchanged. Issue #2, continuous whole-route
and physical-console acceptance remain open.

## 2026-10-07: r22j published

The [r22j test release](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/tag/play-r22j-audio-performance-20261007) now includes the accepted room music, indoor
culling and CPU changes below, alongside all r22i fixes. The play checklist
records exact build provenance and validation. The separate scene gains do
not establish physical-console or 30 fps acceptance. Issue #2 remains open.

## 2026-10-07: CPU retry optimization and combined gates accepted

GAME_ATLIST_OVERFLOW=1 is enabled in the play recipe after preserving all shared
H2 (5,699) and bell (6,372) logic/decision records against the accepted culling
baseline. The failed oversized alive-list build is remembered under existing
head/generation guards; the full collision walk and ordering remain unchanged.
The uncapped r104 cabinet view improves 41.310->39.832 SH-4 modeled ms per tick:
drawn 54.961->53.062, skipped 27.647->26.592. Eight consecutive timed frames
1200..1207 are balanced 4/4 and checked against a 32-frame census. Draw parity
flips, so these are mode averages, not exact-frame pairs or rendered FPS.

The enabled image adds 96 text bytes with no linked-span/data growth. The
combined music/cull/CPU build completes s30 340/340 at unchanged 67,680-byte
headroom, restores radio backing and completes New Game's 1,971/2,360/1,175
movies into live r100. See the play checklist for exact scope and limitations.
These different scene gains cannot be added together and do not establish
physical-console or 30 fps acceptance. Published r22i remains unchanged.

## 2026-10-07: owner-path indoor culling integration

PS2_INTERIOR_ACTORS=2 is enabled after H2/bell decision and STRICT-window checks,
1,494 clean displayed-frame scans, 191 matching owner replay checks and the
340-frame s30/radio handoff. The matched untraced s30 headroom is 67,680 bytes,
8,192 less than control. Source 1760..1839 stair ascent averages 39.264->38.369
SH-4 modeled ms across equal drawn/skipped samples; drawn 55.756->53.908,
skipped 22.771->22.829. ACT_CAP=0; the census confirms balanced representative
sampling. See the play checklist for scope and exact gates. The final combined
New Game gate passes with the CPU integration above; r22i is unchanged.

## 2026-10-07: r104/r107 music bank preparation

Candidate after published r22i; not included in r22i.

`ROOM_BGM0` includes r104 and r107's `bio4midi` entry 9. Without that
preparation, its runtime conversion needs 189,760 bytes even at 8 kHz and fails
with 1,804,992 AICA bytes reserved. The prepared 236,640-byte image fits the
existing 264,576-byte BGM0 slot; all layout offsets, other banks and movie
reserve stay unchanged. No runtime code or heap-4 footprint changes.

The chapter 1-3 overlay must be explicitly regenerated and staged: follow
[D367_PLAY_BUILD_CHECKLIST.md](D367_PLAY_BUILD_CHECKLIST.md), "room music bank
preparation". The base four-room `stage.sh` recipe alone is insufficient.
The existing length limit leaves seven long samples at 8 kHz and two at 32 kHz.
A same-binary r107 A/B changes the matched summary from 0 music notes / 39
unmapped events to 39 notes / 0 unmapped events; all nine prepared samples
have nonzero decoded energy. This establishes source-bank playback through
the AICA driver, not physical-console or listening acceptance.
The r104 source arrival/QTE and radio-close replay restores the room and
continues bank-9 notes at -28/-27 dB. World return is log-backed; the following
test input opened Map before the next screenshot. All three grenade types use
the existing PL bank and pass item consumption plus mapped driver key-on checks;
no grenade audio patch is needed under this bounded evidence.

## 2026-10-06: r22i issue fixes

The [r22i test release](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/tag/play-r22i-inventory-animation-fixes-20261006) contains c36a08cc:
ITEM_UI_ORDER=1, PS2_WORLD_PARTS=1, MOVIE_STAGE_ORDER=1 and the two additional
inventory herb texture pairs. Source timing and child-pose ownership are retained.
The play checklist records the logic, movie, interaction and bounded cost gates.
This is not a performance release or a fix for the reported r103 hardware freeze.
PS2_INTERIOR_ACTORS=2 and the room/grenade audio work remain separate followups.

## 2026-10-06: r22f, the issue #2 crash screen and the issue #3 fixes

- r22f = r22e (7cdec176) + the crash screen rework (575b9970, 6cac28d8; issue lamb2k/re4dc#2), PS2_WORLD_DYNAMIC
  (98ef215d, recipe e9e036f7; issue #3) and the r105 emblem check fix (a64cef05). Gates: D367_PLAY_BUILD_CHECKLIST.md
  "r22f".
- Crash screen (CRASH_SCREEN=1, already in the recipe): every KOS thread from thd_each with its wait message, wait
  object and "ever" for an untimed wait; a tasks row (slot:status/tid, Y/R = the slot whose yield/resume semaphore the
  main thread waits on); return address rows for up to three untimed waiters. Test hook crashtest.txt "block" (test
  discs only) blocks the next game task forever: the screen names it ("t8 re4-task sem_wait ... ever", "0:02/8Y").
- Issue #3, drawing: the PS2 world package was static, so scenery the room code moves or hides (the r105 emblem, its
  sliding door, gates, dials, shelves) kept its baked look. PS2_WORLD_DYNAMIC=1 follows each placement's SMD scroll id
  (dc/native/rXXX/ps2-world.ids, tools/ps2_room_ids.py): hidden ids are skipped, moved ids drawn with the object's
  matrix. Part animation (chest lids) is not followed.
- Issue #3, logic (root cause found 2026-10-06): r105_markOpenCk copies only the 3x3 of the emblem's matrix into a
  local Mtx and PSMTXMultVec adds the translation column, which stayed uninitialised stack. On the GameCube that slot
  held zeros by chance; on the Dreamcast it held whatever the stack had, so the check failed and the door never opened
  after the correct turns (Up, Left). A debug print in the function changed the stack and hid the bug, which is why
  the first repro "worked". a64cef05 zeroes m[0..2][3] in Dreamcast builds only. Lesson: a port result that changes
  when a print is added points at uninitialised memory.
- Heap 4 at r100 s30 (warp build, final fixture, heap_before / s30 frames):

  | build | heap_before | s30 |
  |---|---|---|
  | r22e | 92,640 | 340/340 |
  | crash screen + pc2 cull | 92,640 | 340/340 |
  | issue #3 + pc2 cull | 87,456 | 340/340 |
  | crash screen + issue #3 (r22f) | 87,456 | 340/340 |
  | r22f, scoped rifle armed | 56,576 | 340/340 |
  | all three | 79,264 | FAILS (0/340) |
  | all three, scoped rifle armed | 75,008 | 340/340 |

- So the pc2 owner-path interior cull (PS2_INTERIOR_ACTORS=2, branch land/r22f-pc2-20261006) waits: with all three
  the s30 movie does not start. It comes back once MOVIE_STAGE_ORDER (25c4cd0f, the next build) gives route movies
  their heap 4 room.

## 2026-10-06: r22e, the PS2 haze in the play recipe

- User 2026-10-06 ("I really want the haze sorted out PS2 style"): EFFECT_PS2_HAZE=1 EFFECT_PS2_STREAK=2 in
  build-r21.sh (no toggle). r100 s30 heap_before 102,944 with the r22e knobs (115,232 knobs off); the haze is ~12 KB.

## 2026-10-05: r22 test disc, the VMU GPU line and the round-2 experiments (local session)

- **Lane ms (measurement; tools on local exp/ms-20261005 ffbc8ade + 72a474ec; evidence ms-20261005):** presets
  r100-h-out, -pre03, -call, -prejump, -stairs, -shoot (fixtures /root/probe/lanes-20261005/ms/fixtures). Console
  factor (console ms / model ms) is about **1.03 when only the indoor world is submitted** (pre03, call) and **~1.15-1.20
  when the outdoor PS2 world is submitted** (outside idle, the fight, the staircase: the outdoor world behind the
  house walls); mechanism unknown (hypothesis: TA FIFO / store-queue / bus contention the SH-4 model does not see). The
  old 0.937 house factor is withdrawn. With these the model predicts call 86% (console 87%), fight 70% (70%), stairs
  foot 66% (67%: console row 4 "before the window jump" is the staircase, user: "when the glare hits"). Stairs foot
  87.5 model ms per pair vs 67 at the back window: world draw 16.0 (the outdoor world behind the walls, 14.3k OP tris),
  3 hidden Ganados drawn behind the walls 4.6, source lighting 1.9. GPU: translucent area model GPU ~ 3.83 ms per
  screen of translucent area - 6.5 (RMS 1.1 ms on four console rows). The outdoor GPU cost is camera-near mist sprites
  (sa/1-sa, 128 VQ 4444, ~45 sprites within 0-5 m): ~40 of 53 ms in the fight, 32 of 43 outdoors. The staircase glare
  is the same kind of camera-near additive sprite (sa/1, most likely Esp 0x15 weather particles), ~11 screens upstairs
  (projected GPU 55-65 ms; the console's 14 ms reading was at the stair foot), ~0.3 ms CPU; not a lens flare (espgen01
  and Esp 0x0E never run in r100; GXPeekZ is a stub). Mist options (look changes, user decision; PS2 version as the
  reference, user 2026-10-05): fight GPU 53 -> halve count 31.7, drop sprites nearer than 3 m 23.5, cap 0.25 screen
  per sprite 34.7.
- **Lane ps: no change possible.** The game already runs the PVR in presort (native_ui.cpp re4dc_ui_init
  autosort_disabled=1 since 4123a85a; KOS writes the tile presort bit; Flycast honours it). ms's earlier
  "autosort passes" were geometry-only; the presort projection (53 -> 31 ms) was wrong and is withdrawn.
- **Lane el: FAIL (bar 2.0 hw ms per tick).** cEmMgr::move ~10.8 ms per tick (0.62-0.68 per Ganado update x ~11;
  motion 2.6, skeleton 2.4, foot IK maths 1.1, lines ~2.6, sphere 0.7, crows 2.2). Exact reuse is rare (idle
  animations change skeletons every tick; crows never repeat). GAME_LQ_MEMO=1 (wallAdjust's second line query reuses
  the first when pos is bit-identical) is exact, -0.20..-0.27 per tick, gates pass; to land default off. Trap: the
  house look-freeze fixture changes when a build gets faster; compare against a timing control.
  **Landed 2f13c092** (GAME_LQ_MEMO and EL_CENSUS, default 0; not in the recipe, off by policy).
- **Lane iv Step 2: CROWD_INVIS_SKIP** (exp/iv-20261005, local): fight -2.19 hw ms per drawn tick (source-path body
  off screen); H2 STRICT, bell STRICT, =2 0 violations, 0 MISALIGN; TA streams equal except 2 of 2166 fight frames
  (CROWD_LOD near-rank bookkeeping): being made exact with a crowd_tier note hook before landing.
  **Landed f58d93ea..5d5f8f6c** (ENC_CENSUS=2, CROWD_INVIS_SKIP + TA_HASH=2/3, tools/d367/iv; the final commits keep a
  skipped Ganado's CROWD_LOD entry and skip only settled parts: TA streams identical). **CROWD_INVIS_SKIP=1 is in the
  play recipe (user 2026-10-05)**, about -2.0 hw ms per drawn fight tick.
- **Lane ph (PS2 haze / streak / near fade; landed 88f30aaf, knobs default 0).** Source: PS2 SLUS_211.34 r100.dat EFF
  against GC r100_008.EFF (private notes /root/probe/lanes-20261005/ps2mist/NOTES.md). The DC "mist" is the camera
  haze Esp 0x15 (tex 0x1f): GC r100 60 sprites, 1283 mm (~2.7 m steady), alpha 70, near fade 3.5 -> 1.0 m; PS2 11
  sprites, 2000 mm (~4 m), alpha 34, near fade 3.0 -> 0.5 m; r101 GC 39 / alpha 25 vs PS2 8 / alpha 35; r103 PS2 11. The
  PS2 removed every r100 mist sheet / puff and the house window streaks (Esp0a, the staircase glare), replacing the
  stairs one with a static e9 light shaft; the cut is in the data (Espgen SetFreeWork copies num unclamped).
  - **Fade-wrap bug (port):** ChannelSet's near-fade rate goes negative inside m_Del_near; the GC stores the u8 with
    psq_st through GQR2 (saturating to 0), SH-4 ftrc + extu.b wrapped it to ~254, so sprites within ~1 m drew almost
    opaque: the white upstairs-window glare. **EFFECT_FADE_CLAMP=1 is in the play recipe (user 2026-10-05).**
  - In GC haze mode the native sprite queue's 64-sprite cap fills with haze (peak 54-58 haze sprites), dropping blood
    and other late sprites; the PS2 haze leaves room.
  - GPU proxy (lane ph tatab.json, model GPU ms per preset, GC / GC+clamp / PS2 haze / PS2 haze+streak): house outside
    42.8 / 39.3 / 21.1 / 21.1; fight 53.2 / 52.3 / 24.5 / 24.5; shoot 59.1 / 57.7 / 33.2 / 33.2; call 12.6 (all);

    bigger, more opaque sprites).**
  - EFFECT_PS2_HAZE=1, EFFECT_PS2_STREAK=1 (=2 draws the PS2 light shafts) wait for the user's look decision on the
    console; **r22h** is a local test disc only (r22c content + EFFECT_PS2_HAZE=1 EFFECT_PS2_STREAK=2
    EFFECT_FADE_CLAMP=1 EFFECT_PS2_TOGGLE=1, not released): hold **X + START** to step GC -> GF -> PH -> PS (the VMU
    speed page names the look).
- **Lane pc: PS2_INTERIOR_CULL + PS2_INTERIOR_ACTORS (in the play recipe, coordinator 2026-10-06; render-only).** An
  offline r100 house cell (170 sub-cells, 1186 portals, tools/d367/ps2world/interior) culls the outdoor PS2 world and
  the source-path Ganados (via CROWD_INVIS_SKIP) hidden behind the house walls. First landed default off: the tables in
  the image cost 47,200 B of heap 4 and the r100 s30 movie failed (0/340). Now the tables are the disc file
  dc/native/r100/interior.cell (interior-r100.cell, cell_file.py), read into one r100-only heap-4 block (38,440 B with
  both frustum arrays) when the r100 package opens; every route movie borrows it (native_movie.cpp open, before
  heap_before) and route_movie_bridge.cpp reads it again; no block = no cull. Static cost 9,056 B. Landed-tree gates (584f28f7, recipe incl.

  Follow-ups: h-quiet's camera is inside the house, its cell tests cost +0.42 hw ms with nothing culled (eval's
  all-direction hidden share cannot tell it from the stair foot: 27% vs 26%); a runtime adaptive skip (no hidden
  placement for N frames -> skip tests for M frames) would fix it; owner-path actors. docs/lanes/pc-20261005.md.
- **Heap-4 gate (coordinator 2026-10-06): every landing that grows .text, .rodata or .bss, or uses more heap 4, runs H2 through r100 s30 with its knobs on, confirms s30 plays 340/340 and reports heap_before at s30; the New Game gate stops before s30 and does not count.**

- **WEAPON_HEAP4=1 in the play recipe (issue lamb2k/re4dc#1 option 3, coordinator decision (a) 2026-10-06):** a
  weapon body whose MRAM parts exceed the 275,424 B resident block (the r104 merchant's rifle 398,144 / with scope
  404,608, rocket launcher 382,688, TMP 289,248 / with stock 299,200) is read into heap 4, the room heap, as Krauser's
  body goes to Game.pWepBuf (ReadWepData sums the DRS header's type-0 parts, as cDvdQueue sizes an allocated
  destination); bodies that fit keep the resident block. gameRoomMemInit releases the heap-4 body and the next room's
  player constructor reads it again: **about +0.3 s per door** while one is held (13,496 vs 13,179 ms, r104 -> r107).
  Heap 4 short after one motion-key eviction pass: the equip is **reverted** to the previously loaded weapon's
  inventory slot (or bare hands) with pArm / m_wep_id / weapon_no / weapon_type / bullet_type set to match ("weapon
  heap4 alloc failed"); a route movie short of heap 4 borrows the body and gets it back after the movie (r100 s30
  with the scoped rifle armed: 340/340, rifle restored). **Heap-4 low-water with an oversize body held:** r100 745 KB
  (largest 400 KB), r101 569 KB, r104 ~3.2 MB, **r107 only ~100-109 KB** (508 KB with the handgun), and in r107
  **the scoped rifle (404,608) reverts to the plain rifle** when heap 4 is short (seen in every r107 weapon pass).
  Follow-up (b): free heap 4 in r107 so the scoped rifle fits with >= 300 KB left. Gates (knob on vs off, clean
  builds, missing.txt empty): knob-off image byte-identical to adecf770; every stage-1 weapon in turn in r100 / r101

  WEAPON_HEAP4_FAILTEST=1 (test only) reverts every oversize equip with no halt; recipe image New Game 1971 / 2360 /
  1175, HALT 0. The warp rig runs at most 8 `arm` lines.
- **PRIM_CAP_R107=327680 WEAPON_HEAP4_TOP=1 in the play recipe (follow-up (b), 2026-10-06):** heap-4 census in
  r107 (466,624 B free with the handgun, 64,096 B with the rifle; largest holders read.cpp 2.85 MB, native parts
  1.86 MB, static packages 938 KB, the primitive buffer 589,888 B). PRIM_WATER (test only) measured the primitive
  buffer's peak use per r107 frame at 269,824 B (game primitives ~20 KB, the native actor workspace tail 249,600 B),
  so PRIM_CAP_R107 caps the room value 589,824 to 327,680; "tail declined" (the actor tail falling back to a smaller
  workspace) stays 0 in every r107 run with and without the cap. WEAPON_HEAP4_TOP carves the heap-4 weapon body from
  the top of the highest free cell (as room_alloc4_high), so the space a weapon change frees stays one piece.
  **r107 heap-4 low-water with the scoped rifle (404,608 B): 360-367 KB, no revert** (every-weapon pass 367,200,
  scoped rifle aimed and fired 360,736, door into r107 with it 363,296). Gates: H2 through s30 340/340 knob on and

  r107 frozen look (CROWD_FREEZE_AT=1200) pixel-identical knob on vs off. Knob-off image byte-identical; +160 B text.
- **Known edge case: em2a with the scoped rifle in r100 (accepted 2026-10-06):** holding the scoped rifle in heap 4
  through the r100 s20 ambush leaves 81,600 B of heap 4 free against the 276,064 B em2a.drs needs: "EmSetFromList2()
  Em set failed, Id = 2a" (7 times), those ambush Ganados do not spawn. The normal route cannot return to r100 with
  a merchant weapon, so only a warp or cheat reaches it.
- **Pre-existing r104 em13 read failure (found 2026-10-06; fixed in the r22e fixture with the prepared em13):** the play fixtures since r21l carry the r104 AICA
  build's em/em13.drs (6,026,688 B, one 4,367,968 B MRAM part), which never fits heap 4: "DVD: Read Error :
  em/em13.drs", "EmSetFromList2() Em set failed, Id = 13" (7-19 times per r104 visit), so em13 enemies do not spawn
  in r104. Runs staged with the native-scene lane's prepared em13 (6,829,984 B, MRAM 1,231,776 B) load it once.
- **Issue lamb2k/re4dc#1 (r22c console halt, 2026-10-05) and option C (landed 89035a54 + d72fd6a4):** equipping the
  r101 shotgun and leaving the inventory halted with "asset exceeds selected resident budget". Three layers: (1) the
  weapon resident block (WEAPON_RESIDENT_BYTES=247776) held only the compact handgun (wep02), so ReadWepData /
  SubScreenExit's weaponLoad rejected every bigger body; (2) only wep02 was a natively linked weapon module, so the
  other weapons' REL link would halt in DLL_Link ("DLL link/unlink failed"); (3) em/wep20, wep21 and wep24 were
  missing from the disc (now converted from the GC files by le_mirror, which reproduces the shipped wep07 / wep09
  byte for byte). Option C (user 2026-10-05): WEAPON_RESIDENT_BYTES=275424 (the largest chapter 1-1 weapon) and
  WEAPON_MODULES=1 (wep01 / 07 / 09 / 11 / 13 / 19 linked; knob off is byte-identical to 348bfd23). Weapon body sizes:

  67 KB and s30 still plays (MOVIE_HEAP_EVICT). Still open: **buying the rifle, rocket launcher or TMP at the

- **r22 (local test disc, not released):** the 3f4b599d recipe below; C:/RE4DC-Play-Discs/r22-title + r22-gdemu (ELF
  8bb30322), GDEMU SD folder 154. Its 73% fight speed is a PROJECTION: 59.10 + 23.18 = 82.28 model ms per pair x 1.107
  = ~91.1 console ms; full speed needs ~22 model ms (~24.4 console ms if the calibration holds) off the pair. Not yet
  measured on the console.
- **PACE_VMU_GPU=1 (88890b4e, test knob, default 0; needs PACE_VMU=1):** a fourth VMU line `GPU <mean>/<max>` = PVR
  render ms per scene over the page's 60-field window (KOS rnd_last_time's interval: ISP_START to the TSP render-done
  interrupt; a render waiting for the previous one is not included; interrupt latency is). Counted once per render by
  wrapping pvr_sync_stats at link time (only with the knob). The RAM log's "PACE vmu" line adds the scene-to-render
  queue wait (the direct sign of the GPU holding the CPU up). tools/flycast-harness/read_vmu_lcd.py saves the page out
  of a running Flycast. Gates: knob-off identity, H2 STRICT, 0 MISALIGN (1800 s), New Game -> r100. Reading it: the
  GPU limits fps only when the mean approaches 1000/fps (66.7 ms at 15 fps). Console test disc r22g = r22 + this line.
- **Round-2 experiments (exp/<lane>-20261005 on 3f4b599d; brief /root/probe/lanes-20261005/LANE-BRIEF.md), savings are
  hypotheses until measured:**
  - fm, gameplay-equivalent logic maths under the 2026-09-23 (3) policy (precedent GAME_SKEL_FTRV): first an r22
    logic cost breakdown with an upper bound per candidate; only candidates >= 0.3 ms per tick are built. PASS if the
    kept knobs save >= 1.0 hw ms per tick in the fight with clean automated decision comparisons (AI decisions,
    hits/damage, collision and grounding, area/event, RNG, progression) against run-to-run control pairs on H2, the
    r101 bell run and r100-h-fight; playtests are added on top, not instead (user review 2026-10-05). GAME_SH4_MATH,
    GAME_FDLIBM and GAME_PS_ALIAS are already 1 in r22 (makefile defaults: read resolved-knobs.txt, not only
    build-r21.sh's list).
  - ln, a native Leon rendering pipeline proof of concept (gameplay skeleton preserved, render-only): Leon's real r22
    cost first; PASS if it cuts Leon's attributable drawn-tick cost by >= 40% and >= 1.5 hw ms in the fight, look
    identical, logic STRICT, 0 MISALIGN; then a written plan for Ganados.
- **Console r22g (user, one r100 playthrough; VMU FPS / SPD / CPU / GPU mean-max ms):** outside before the house
  17.6 / 98% / 102% / 43-46; house before the first Ganado 21.8 / 102% / 100% / 14-15; just after the radio call
  12.9 / 87% / 116% / 11-14; inside before the window jump 9.9 / 67% / 150% / 14; fight after the jump, 3 Ganados on
  screen 10.4 / 70% / 142% / 53-55; shooting at the 3 ~9 fps. Findings: the fight projection roughly held (73%
  projected, 70% measured; r21x 66% / 9 fps); the CPU limits every slow moment; the GPU never limits yet but is heavy
  outdoors (43-55 ms: it caps the outdoor fight near 19 fps; 30 fps outdoors needs it <= ~33 ms) and light indoors;
  calibration W1's 52.5 ms was not the GPU (11-14 in that view). The slowest moment (inside before the jump, GPU light)
  and the after-call house (87% vs the r100-h-quiet projection ~100%) have no matching preset yet: a measurement lane
  (ms) is building presets for them and for shooting, and reconciling the model with these readings.
- **Lane fm result (docs/lanes/fm-20261005.md): GAME_ROT_FSCA=1, landed default off, not in the recipe.** The
  skeleton's local-matrix stage (pmc) from FSCA sin/cos in one scheduled SH-4 loop: -1.18 hw ms per tick on both tick
  types in the fight (house -1.17, square -0.96; function level), fight pair 82.26 -> 80.13 model ms (projection:
  73.2% -> ~75.3%, about 2.1 of the ~22 model ms full speed needs). Numerical check: 4.08M parts, max difference
  2.98e-7, 0 mismatches against its C twin (=2). Decision comparison (tools/game30/decision_cmp.py) on H2, the bell run
  and r100-h-fight against base-vs-base controls: RNG, flags, rooms, AI states, em-em collision (696k results), line
  queries (486k), area and damage tests identical; the fight's enemy hash `es` differs on 440 of 7359 ticks, all traced
  (LOGIC_TRACE_EM_FROM/TO) to one non-live alive-list entry (a cEm25 parasite unit, be_flag 0) whose stat / Mot_state
  words hold float data; every live enemy's inputs are identical. Look: skinned characters differ by sub-pixel
  amounts (fight 1703 px, 1675 of them one RGB565 step; scenery identical; same side by side). 0 MISALIGN. GAME_TRIG_FSCA
  (sinf/cosf from FSCA) FAILED the decision gate (line-query answers differ from tick 2003) and stays default 0 as a
  negative result. Adopted by the user later on 2026-10-05 (top bullet: in build-r21.sh with the regenerated
  LINK_ORDER r22-fsca-c3-8k.ld); the console playtest comes with the next test disc (policy 2026-09-23 (3)).
  Trap: r22's .text ends 112 bytes below an 8 KiB step; code growth past it moves rodata/data/bss/heap up 8 KiB.
- **Lane ln result (docs/lanes/ln.md): FAIL against its pre-set bar (>= 40% AND >= 1.5 hw ms of Leon's drawn-tick
  cost), landed default off as an ordinary exact optimisation.** LEON_NATIVE_PIPE (Leon's two owner passes without the
  work they repeated: bind sweep and plan once per binding, fixed semantics proved once, palette bound test, lighter
  preflight, pass-2 hair in one store-queue window) + LEON_FACE_LAZY (Leon's morphed-face CPU skin deferred to its
  first render read; needs SKIN_PALETTE_LAZY): Leon 7.711 -> 5.525 hw ms per drawn r100-h-fight tick (-2.19, 28.3%;
  house 27.6%, square 28.9%); drawn tick 59.10 -> 56.68 (fight), 43.61 -> 41.45 (house). TA streams identical to
  knobs off on every compared frame (polygon header words 4-7 masked: KOS leaves them as cache-line padding), look
  equal, 0 MISALIGN, knob-off image identical. H2: each knob alone STRICT; both together end the radio call one tick
  later because the faster build reaches the call's wall-timed end sooner; with LOGIC_TRACE_DELAY_US (timing-matched)
  STRICT. Verdict on the strategy: the native-pipeline rewrite does not reach the 40% bar on Leon (the rest is the
  vertex kernel, emission and per-meshlet work the exact image needs), so it is not extended to Ganados as a rewrite
  (their owner passes still pay ~0.9 ms of similar proof/lease work per drawn fight tick: a smaller follow-up).
- **Disc fault found:** the 2026-10-04 chapter 1-3 test disc r21z-c13 ships 639 of r22's 3,249 texture packages
  (pack-fixture.sh replaced the fixture's existing dc/tex.pak, dropping its contents; the disc was never booted). Not
  for play. The r22c disc (r22 + ROUTE_CH13=1) uses a corrected fixture and a pack/file superset check against r22.

## 2026-10-05: integrated perf lanes (pushed 3f4b599d)

- **What landed (lane doc docs/lanes/perf-int-20261005.md):** the 2026-10-04/05 fight-plan lanes, each behind its own
  default-off knob, now all in build-r21.sh: sk SKIN_PALETTE_LAZY (lazy source weight palettes); fx ESP_SPRITE_FAST +
  ESP47_SKIP_LEAN (effect sprite pass without unread work; the lane's EspTrans dead-slot skip measured neutral and was
  left out); cl MODEL_PREP_KEEP + CROWD_READOPT_MEMO + ACTOR_BIND_REUSE (draw-plan walk skip across skipped ticks, the
  failed s03 re-adopt remembered, the Ganado owner bind reused; =2 check build bad 0 on fight and square); wd
  PS2_WORLD_HDR_CACHE + MESH_CLIP_ACCEPT + PS2_PASS_MASK (PS2 world header cache, near clip accept path, per-placement
  pass mask); logic GAME_HF_REG + GAME_CLOTH_SPRING + GAME_SND_WALL_ALT (hermite templates, one evaluation per cloth
  spring, SE wall occlusion every other frame: audio only). **PS2_FOLIAGE_FAR stays off** (it changes the look: a
  pending user decision). The warp rig's `freeze <tick>` line (DBG_WARP=1 only) came with the fx lane.
- **LINK_ORDER r21z-perf-c3-8k.ld** (ordgen_c3.py `--skip-weight 1` on the all-knobs cost arm, house + fight + square).
  The README method (no skip weight) measured +0.2..0.4 hw ms WORSE than keeping the r21y order on the new code; with
  the skip weight it is equal to r21y on the square and slightly better on house and fight, with 0 stale rules (the
  r21y order had 3 and left the new hfReg<5/6/0> unplaced). A regenerated order is a placement lottery of a few tenths
  once the placed share is ~88%: measure every candidate.
- **hw ms drawn / skipped (one run per arm, the same scenes: ENC census lines identical in every window):** house
  47.80/24.56 -> 43.61/23.24, fight 66.03/24.45 -> 59.10/23.18, r101 square 78.03/27.87 -> 72.39/26.15. Biggest
  function movers (drawn, fight): model prepare -1.39 (cl), source palettes -0.89 (sk), PS2 headers -0.58 and pass
  mask -0.41 (wd), effect sprites -0.50 (fx), hermite -0.42 (logic), CROWD_READOPT_MEMO -0.32 (cl).
- **Console projection** (REPORT.md factors house 0.937, fight 1.107; VMU model speed = 66.7/(D+S)): house 98.4%
  14.8 fps -> 100% 15.0 fps; fight 66.6% 10.0 fps -> 73.2% 11.0 fps; square (fight factor) 56.9% 8.5 -> 61.1% 9.2.
- **Gates (evidence D:/Flycast-Evidence/re4-dreamcast/int-20261005):** knob-off identity (HEAD without the knobs =
  fresh 51d77d07, play flags, SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH pinned: image + overlay byte-identical, missing.txt empty); H2 STRICT
  vs route-z-strict (1450..1569, to 740, from 1218; whole room om-only); bell whole run STRICT (4577 ticks) vs a
  knob-off 51d77d07 trace build; PACE_FORCE=2 trace pair STRICT outside the radio call window (om/ef drift only, 7027
  ticks); frozen-frame look (warp freeze 2341 r100-h-fight, 1441 r100-h-quiet) identical, apart from 1-RGB565-step
  run-to-run sets that also differ between two runs of one build; 0 MISALIGN (interpreter, 900 s, to frame 14493);
  New Game intros 1971/2360 + s40 1175, radio call, inventory restore x2 and the r100 window jump as r21y. The all-knobs
  trace build's .text crosses the 8 KiB .init alignment (.bss/heap +8 KiB): STRICT anyway.
- **Harness note:** with the host display off, vsync-on Flycasts crawl (vblank 38 in 100 s); the final gates ran
  through the D:-staged drun kit with `rend.vsync = no` (route-run's run-emulator.py has no such switch).

## 2026-10-04: chapter 1-3 behind ROUTE_CH13 (default off) and the fight plan (local session)

- **Chapter 1-3 (b877ae7f, c4ec84e9; ROUTE_CH13=1, not in the play recipe):** the r101 1-3 state, r102, r108, r109 and
  r10a. Second-slot room music (r108 bio4midi #9, r10a #4) is not resident, so those rooms play a track already in
  the BGM0 slot (#5, #3; user: cheapest option, music differs from the original). A door into a room whose
  dc/native/rXXX/ps2-world.r4pw is not on the disc shows "Coming Soon" in the system font and holds (user: not a
  fade back to the title).
- **Gates:** knob-off identity (c-off vs z-play: .text/.data/overlay equal, .rodata 4 `__TIME__` bytes); c-ch13a
  r105 -> r101 -> r102; c-hw3b r108 -> r109 -> r10a -> "Coming Soon" at the r10b door (screenshot); c-newgame
  (ROUTE_CH13=1 play image) intros 1971/2360 then r100; missing 0, halt 0 in all three.
- **Test disc (local, not released):** C:/RE4DC-Play-Discs/r21z-c13-title + r21z-c13-gdemu (ELF dda038cd). ROUTE_CH13
  joins build-r21.sh only after the user plays it on the console.
- **Fight plan (user: "Pursue All"):** logic work is unparked. Lanes: fx (effects sprite fast path, Esp47 skipped
  ticks), cl (owner plan cache, model-prepare plans, ACTOR_BIND_REUSE), wd (packet headers, near clip, foliage cull
  measured), build (LINK_ORDER from r100 house + fight), logic (exact: hermite, pwc, line queries, cloth, cEsp move,
  sound occlusion), crowd (what the AI reads from a render cull, cheaper Ganados, PACE_CAP=2). Model (perf-20261004
  REPORT.md): no-look set -> fight ~74%; + logic -5 ms -> ~86%; + PACE_CAP=2 -> ~100% at ~10 fps. 15 fps at full
  speed in the fight needs drawing ~25 ms and logic ~19 per pair; 30 fps needs drawing <= ~18 and logic <= ~15.
- **Releases:** the r21v and r21x release pages are deleted (tags kept); r21y is the only release.
- **Landed 2026-10-05, lane build:** the play recipe's LINK_ORDER is now link-order/r21y-house-fight-square-c3-8k.ld
  (regenerated from the perf-20261004 cost arm on house, fight and square; the r101-square order placed only 47-57%
  of today's hot hw ms, the new one 87-88%). Code placement only, STRICT on H2. hw ms drawn / skipped: house
  48.83/24.75 -> 47.83/24.59, fight 67.04/24.64 -> 66.08/24.47, square 79.35/28.17 -> 78.13/27.90. Console
  projection: house 96.7% 14.5 fps -> 98.3% 14.7, fight 65.7% 9.9 -> 66.5% 10.0. tools/d367/ordcheck.py reports
  stale rules and the placed share before each release (tools/d367/README.md). The warp rig's `god` and
  `alert <frame>` lines (DBG_WARP=1 only) landed with it for the benchmark presets.
- **Landed 2026-10-05, lane crowd (docs/lanes/crowd.md):**
  - No logic reads the Ganados' render side: CROWD_DRAW_MAX=2 and ENC_SKIP_GANADO=1 (no emTrans/ModelTrans at all)
    are both STRICT on r100-h-fight (ACT_CAP=0, 5034 ticks). perf-20261004 REPORT.md's "hiding Ganados changed
    logic" was a bucket.py attribution shift (LOGIC vs other); every logic function's hw ms in functions.tsv is
    equal within 0.006 ms. Compare logic with functions.tsv, not the LOGIC bucket. A Ganado render cull is a look
    question only.
  - Cheaper Ganados that keep the look do not pay: the far tier on every Ganado saves 0.15 ms per drawn Ganado,
    under cross-build noise; CROWD_EARLY_FOG and CROWD_CULL_EARLY were rejected. Next exact item: lazy source
    weight palettes (REPORT #7; ~-0.6 ms fight, -1.1 square).
  - Pacing knobs, default off: PACE_FORCE=T (test pattern: draw one, drop two) and PACE_CAP2_SPEED=N (with
    PACE_CAP=2, the second consecutive skip only while one skip per image leaves the game below N% speed). A
    second skip costs the same as a first; D S S is STRICT on the r101 square (4951 ticks). Console projection
    with PACE_CAP=2: fight 66% 9.9 fps -> 78% 7.8 fps (86% 8.6 with the no-look set); house 97% 14.5 -> 100% 13.5
    (unchanged at 97% 14.5 with PACE_CAP2_SPEED=90). Turning it on in the play recipe is the user's call (speed
    vs fps).

## 2026-10-04: r21y, the camera crash fix (local session)

- **Cause (confirmed in Flycast):** every cCamera destructor does `memset(this, 9, 0x200)` (our GCC drops the base
  vtable store, so a destroyed extra's vtable word is 0x09090909), and EndLookDownEm, endPushObject, endScope and
  LowerBinocular deleted `extra` without clearing it. The user's path: after s20, A on the dead s03 Ganado runs
  r100_MesGanado (StartLookDownEm / EndLookDownEm), then the window jump registers an attach camera and
  checkAttachCamera's `delete extra` loads @(4,0x09090909): FAULT 0xE0 on the console, a silent guest reset in Flycast
  (every pass, at the window jump). roomInit was refuted (extra 0, hip 1082 above the feet at every entry), but its
  m_Free fill now runs before the init-time Check()/Move() too.
- **Fix (dd995a7b, port-side, `#if defined(RE4DC_GAME) && !defined(__PPC__)`):** the four end* paths set extra = NULL
  after the delete, as Move case 5 already did. Non-crashing paths are unchanged: every reader of extra runs after a
  start* / MotionSet built a new object; `if (extra) delete extra` now skips instead of faulting.
- **Also:** PACE_VMU's CPU line is now % of a 30 Hz tick (564f5168), after the user read "CPU 34" (ms) as idle.
- **Gates:** builds z-play / z-warp / z-tr missing 0; z-window (the user's path) plays past the jump with no reset (the r21x twin resets there every pass); New Game intros 1971/2360 + s40 1175; radio call; inventory restore ok x2; H2 STRICT vs r21x's y-strict (1450..1569, to 740, from 1218; om only in the call window); GDI boot to the VMU prompt; every run HALT 0, MISSING 0. ELF z-play f6a82e3f; disc r21y-title disc.bin 6808dc0b, r21y-gdemu track03.bin 7a37f37a.
- **Lesson:** a Flycast "log head decreased: reset" can be a console fault (a wild jump); check old runs with it.

## 2026-10-04: r21x, the first console fixes, the VMU speed page and the console calibration (local session)

The user played r21v on the console (NTSC, GDEMU, S-Video) and ran the hardware calibration disc.
- **Crash after the first radio call and on Y (fault 0xE0, Trans+0x166).** SubScreenExec swaps the 3 MiB window at
  pG->pStFnt, which holds heap 4 and the demand pools' obj / em works; Trans() still walked ObjMgr / EmMgr's alive
  lists and read sub screen bytes as pNext. Flycast reads on; the SH-4 raises an address error on an odd pointer.
  Every Disp_flg hide bit is set during the swap, so the callbacks wrote nothing: Trans now skips both walks (and the
  coarse plan) while re4dc_ss_ui_order() says the window is swapped. With SUBSCREEN=1 the hook is a strong reference
  and tools/link.sh fails the link if it would become a generated stub (a stub returns 0 and silently re-opens the
  fault). Any per-frame walk of a manager list during a sub screen is the same fault class (new rooms: check it).
- **Bridge "tan block" (r100, after s20):** an invisible gameplay blocker (AEV wall area / sceAtSetScrAt piece) drawn by
  the coarse image as a flat wall over the PS2 world. COARSE_SAT_SCENERY_ONLY=1 draws no collision piece when another
  path draws the scenery.
- **Tan frame before calls / the inventory:** FOG_BACKGROUND made the PVR background the fog colour while every
  Disp_flg hide bit was set; the GameCube's copy clear is black. SS_BG_BLACK=1.
- **Audio "lost" during calls:** the call screen ducks the BGM and pauses the SEs for the voice stream, and
  aica_str.dat had no call voices. aica_banks.py CALL_VOICE_STREAMS (1:140, 141, 142, 144, 145, 152; ~4 MB).
- **PACE_VMU=1:** the VMU LCD shows FPS (drawn), SPD (% of 30 ticks/s), CPU (ms per tick before the vblank wait) and
  the pacing mode once a second; one queued maple write a second, pace state only. User: the VMU fps build is the main
  build from now on.
- **Gates (y builds of a0618068):** missing 0; New Game intros 1971/2360 + s40 1175 (27-30 fps); radio call with its voice (stream 1:141); inventory restore ok x2 with the Trans guard logging; no bridge wall; H2 STRICT 1450..1569 / to 740 / from 1218 (om only in the call window, as before); the GDEMU image boots to the VMU prompt; every run HALT 0, MISSING 0. The link.sh check refuses a stub for the hook when the guard is compiled (tested in isolation). ELF y-play fe7a3895; disc r21x-final-title disc.bin 81fc2d00, r21x-final-gdemu track03.bin d44fcb0e.
- **Console calibration (D:/RE4DC-HWCAL-r21v; results /root/probe/hwcal-v/CONSOLE-RESULTS-20261004.md, private).**
  The model stands: every window's drawn tick is inside PREDICTIONS.md's range.

  | Window | LOGIC hw (model) | drawn tick hw: P99 / LOGIC + render cycles (model range) | PVR |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 quiet | 12.7 (12.0) | 55.5 / 52.7 (44.5-61.0) | 52.5 (?) |
  | 2 view | 12.7 (11.6) | 81.5 / 68.2 (61.2-82.5) | 21.3 |
  | 3 4 Ganados | 15.9 (14.7) | 104.5 / 95.4 (77.3-107.2) | 21.9 |
  | 4 6 Ganados | 18.3 (17.1) | 102.5 / 93.3 (75.7-105.4) | 21.3 |
  | 5 8 Ganados | 20.3 (18.9) | 94.5 / 89.8 (73.0-101.6) | 23.3 |

  Logic x1.06-1.09 against the model, drawn render x0.95-1.06. FENCE 0.1 (CPU-bound); render I-cache stalls 8.5-18.7
  ms per drawn frame. Door r100 -> r100 4.9 s / 50 frames (Flycast 4.2 s / 41). Caveats: the PMC events rotate by
  frame % 6 while fast pacing alternates drawn / skipped ticks, so the render-side events split by phase (IPCR,
  D-REND and DSTLR are not comparable); P50 sits at the drawn / skip boundary; TA-KB read 0 (sampled after the TA
  reset); the VMU write failed (-7), so the photos are the record.
- **Open console crash on r21x (user photo, ui frame 27786, r100, as Leon jumps out of the house window; A pressed):**
  FAULT 0xE0 in CameraControl::checkAttachCamera's `delete extra`: extra points at m_Free whose vtable word is
  0x09090909, the fill roomInit writes AFTER its init-time Check()/Move() (Check can create a CameraLookAt there when
  the player's hip is <= 500 above his feet). Suspected: the window jump's attach camera deletes an extra wiped at r100's room start (the low pose
  before the player is posed), which r0 had left without clearing.
  Fixed in r21y (see "r21y": the cause was four end* paths leaving a destroyed extra, not roomInit).
- **VMU readings (user, r21x on the console):** the r100 house 15 fps / 97% / CPU 34 ms; the fight after the window
  jump 9 fps / 66% / 50-60 ms. CPU is ms per tick (all ticks): >33.3 means the CPU is saturated even with skipped draws.
  The next build shows it as a percentage.
- **Decision (user 2026-10-04):** next is performance work on drawing. Logic fits its 24 ms budget on the console
  and stays parked.

## 2026-10-04: r21v, the performance knobs in the play recipe (local session)

User 2026-10-04: "turn on all of the performant features", cut r21v, release it in place of r21t, and test it on a
console. build-r21.sh's recipe now carries the supervisor's 82.65 ms knob set (fe50a85a): PS2_WORLD_REGISTRY,
PS2_OPEN_READ, SCENERY_ENCODING, PS2_WORLD_FOG_SOURCE, ACTOR_APPEARANCE_ALIAS=2, ACTOR_GANADO_SOURCE_LIGHT,
ACTOR_LIGHT_N16, NATIVE_MODEL_REGISTRY (+_PACK, _TX, _PALBOUND), ACTOR_PL08 (+_PACK), SS_CERT, MESH_VP_SCHED,
ACTOR_PROOF_LEAN, MESH_STRIP_LEAN and ACTOR_MATERIAL_RECORD.
- **Left off:** the early-admission experiment (-6.11 ms), the diagnostics, and WORLD_STAGE/ROOM_MODULES and
  EM1F_SHARED (on in both measured arms, so no proven gain).
- **Disc:** dc/native/r100, r101 and r103 registry.re4nmr (frozen r7), dc/native/pl08/leon_pl08.re4cp, and a tex.pak of
  3,249 packages (r21u's plus the six registry animal textures and the pl08 atlas). Rooms without a registry package
  log "NMRPACK ... none" and draw those actors on the source path.
- **Image:** +48.5 KB (_end 8c3b00bc -> 8c3bc29c), out of the room heap; room entries still show ~8 MB heap-4 free.
- **Flycast (proxy) vs r21u's code:**
  - r100 gameplay 24.3 -> 25.9 fps at 100% speed;
  - r101 bell fight busy windows 16.7/19.0/18.3 -> 17.7/20.7/19.8 fps, steady draw 27.1 -> 24.8 ms;
  - r103 +3-7%.
- **Gates (all HALT 0, MISSING 0):**
  - inventory r100 / r104: open/close restore hashes ok, screens as r21u;
  - New Game: intros 1971/1971, 2360/2360, s40 1175/1175;
  - chapter end: r106s00 1738/1738 -> VMU syswrite rc=0 -> r104s00 4856/4856 -> missed QTE;
  - route checks: r100 calls 1465/571/340, r101 bell events released, r103 entry;
  - registry packages validated in r100/r101/r103, and the pl08 pack published in r104;
  - the GDEMU image boots in Flycast (high-density TOC) to the VMU prompt, crash screen armed, no fault.
- **STRICT, and a test-fixture finding.** On H2, r21v closes the radio-call sub screen one tick earlier (1217 vs
  1218), then diverges, as a different-speed build would: the call's end follows wall time, even with the warp rig's
  `act_clock source`. The timing control proves it. The r21u-equivalent trace build with LOGIC_TRACE_DELAY_US=5000
  shifts identically. r21v vs that delayed control: all 6,204 common ticks identical apart from `om` in the
  sub-screen swap window (741..1217). So H2 STRICT across the call needs equal frame times; compare a faster build
  against a timing-matched control.
- **Console:** r21v is the first build with these features on a console (user test via GDEMU). Watch r100/r101/r103
  entry (the registry pack reader) and the first no-jacket Leon in r104 (the pl08 pack); the crash screen reports
  misaligned accesses that Flycast hides.

## 2026-10-04: supervisor code landed default-off (local session)

experiment/supervisor-20261004's code is on dreamcast-port, every feature default-off. None of it is in the play
recipe; turning any of it on in play builds is a separate decision (user, 2026-10-04). The pushed experiment branch is
unchanged.
- **Commits.** 038d1c59's 62-file snapshot is split into described commits (one per feature):
  - game code: PS2_WORLD_REGISTRY (with world_registry.py and its tests), SCENERY_ENCODING, PS2_OPEN_READ /
    PS2_OPEN_TRACE, PS2_WORLD_FOG_SOURCE, WORLD_STAGE_MODULES / WORLD_ROOM_MODULES, ACTOR_APPEARANCE_ALIAS,
    ACTOR_PL08, ACTOR_GANADO_SOURCE_LIGHT for pl08, LOGIC_TRACE_SWAPPED, WARP_JUMP and act_clock;
  - tools: the PS2 texture CRC rule, em13 in the Ganado contract, room bring-up tables, native_scene_coverage.py;
  - test-only extras: H2_EXTERNAL_DELAY and LOGIC_TRACE_OBJ_FROM/TO (make plumbing only, no consumer yet).

  The NATIVE_MODEL_REGISTRY family, ACTOR_LIGHT_N16, ACTOR_PL08_PACK, the early-admission checkpoint (lost 6.11 ms,
  must stay off) and the supervisor docs come over as separate commits. The docs are corrected: the r104 inventory
  cause was 6819f3a2's bug, the missing spaces are restored, and the 82.65 ms candidate's knob set is in
  SUPERVISOR_BASELINE_20261004.md. Every commit uses the session's git identity.
- **Review findings settled.**
  - MESH_STRIP_LEAN vs TA_HASH: hook added. strips_lean() re-walks each lean run under TA_HASH and hashes every
    emitted strip as emit_sq() does; =2 with TA_HASH is an `#error`, since its compare would hash a RAM dry run.
    Gate: =3 SELECT=0 vs SELECT=1 with TA_HASH=1 on H2 (150 s): all 1,283 game frames identical (1,198 with scene
    content). Only the two wall-timed movie stalls (frames 244 and 660: r100s03 and the next movie, no world
    meshlets) order their presents differently.
  - dbgwarp_bridge.cpp: accepted unguarded. It is linked only with DBG_WARP=1 (test builds, never a user disc).
    `entry <n>`, act_clock (default wall = the old behaviour) and the kill watch (log lines) change no existing
    fixture. Evidence: r100 calls, r101 bell and r103 entry on the merged tree give the same warp lines as the
    landing tree, apart from the new kill-watch log lines.
  - Tool defaults: accepted as documented in their commits. ps2_room_r4im.py writes payload_crc32 over the descriptor
    + texels, the rule the runtime checks; regenerated .re4tex differ in bytes 36..39 only and on-disc packages are
    unchanged until regenerated. prepare_enemy_motions.py prepares em13 with the Ganado contract. No image changes.
  - test_ps2_world_registry.py without pycdlib: the import now follows the base-disc check (24 tests, 0 errors with
    pycdlib blocked). test_compact_room's r102 assertion matches compact_room's new message.
    native_scene_coverage.py reads the hand list again (it returned no rooms after the registry patch).
- **Gates (merged tree).**
  - Knob-off identity vs the tip: the play recipe's .text, .data and overlay are identical (rodata __TIME__ only),
    and only dbgslot_bridge.o differs (__TIME__). Warp and trace builds differ only in dbgwarp_bridge.o (+1.5 KB
    .text) and the shifted overlay. Missing symbols 0 everywhere.
  - STRICT (play recipe + LOGIC_TRACE, H2, vs the tip's trace build): ticks 1450..1569 120/120 STRICT. Whole r100
    room, 6,553 ticks: every discrete field identical; `om` differs on 477 ticks, 741..1217 only. That is the
    radio-call sub screen with the parts' memory swapped out, the same window as the review-fixes landing gate.
    STRICT before 741 and from 1218. HALT 0, MISSING 0.
  - Host tests: 72 files / 394 tests (tip 69 / 356). The same 14 files fail on the tip (stale fixtures, host
    toolchain); none is new. New: texcrc 4, world registry 24, scenery encoding 10 OK. Private-data gates:
    registry pack r100 27/27, r101 36/36, r103 37/37; pl08 pack 18 variants; SS_CERT; codec gate.
  - Inventory re-capture: r104 open/close, restore hashes 1fe8aaa5 and 3dd47187 ok, the inventory complete as on the
    landing tree (likewise r100: 295ba799, 62ca21d7). Chapter end (r106 -> r104): r106s00 1738/1738,
    VMU syswrite rc=0, r104s00 4856/4856, missed QTE -> s02 25/25, as on r21u.
  - Route checks on the merged warp build: r100 calls 1465/571/340, r101 bell events released, r103 entry; HALT 0,
    MISSING 0, source-OT rejected 17/49/0 as before.
- **Publication note.** Like the base tree's actor_material_records.inc, the new tools and .inc files name private
  host paths and hashes of private source files, but no asset bytes.

## 2026-10-04: lane review-fixes landed (local session)

lane/review-fixes-20261004 is landed on dreamcast-port with two follow-ups. Gates and numbers are in
docs/lanes/review-fixes.md "Landing" and in the commit messages.
- **TEX_PACK retry spacing.** Init attempts are now 30 frames apart (3 of them), then one every 300 frames. The
  first gate run showed that one read error at room entry made the whole room preload skip (~240 picks, against 1
  with 80912a72's back-to-back retries). Follow-up: the preload runs again once the pack settles (FAULT=1: 147 loads,
  control 148; FAULT=3: recovers on the 300-frame attempt, no room change). A truncated pack is INVALID, as intended.
- **TA_HASH.** The hook now covers whole meshlets. A/A over 3,328 frames is identical, and AVK=2 shows 0 mismatches.
  The MESH_STRIP_LEAN gap is closed by the hook added when the supervisor code landed (section above).
- **Tool checks.**
  - build-r21.sh fails on dead knobs.
  - route-build.sh requires resolved-knobs.txt.
  - route-build.sh now actually reports missing symbols: link.sh writes them to the tree's game/obj/missing.txt, so
    the old OBJDIR check could never fire.
- **STRICT finding.** In H2, the logic trace's `om` (object parts world matrices) differs between builds on ticks
  741..1217 only: the radio-call sub screen, while the parts' memory is swapped out for it. Discrete fields and
  every other tick are identical, and an A/A pair of one build is STRICT. Whole-room STRICT claims on H2 therefore
  need the sub-screen window excluded, or LOGIC_TRACE_SWAPPED (experiment branch, Phase B).
- **Not changed.** The ~30-frame wait after a pack read error still leaves untextured UI quads undrawn (539 in the
  FAULT=1 run). A truncated pack on a packed disc logs "package rejected: open failed" on every lookup (broken media,
  per the failure policy).
- **Play disc r21u** (checklist step 6), cut from b730bf1a: C:/RE4DC-Play-Discs/r21u-title (disc.bin sha 709bb5a4) and
  r21u-gdemu (disc.gdi 1bac5c9d), launcher Play-r21u-Review-Fixes.cmd. The GDI itself boots in Flycast to the VMU
  prompt. New Game plays both intros to r100 and s40; the chapter end saves to the VMU and enters r104. The r100 and
  r104 inventory restore hashes match the landing gate. HALT 0, MISSING 0 throughout. Not released.

## 2026-10-04: local experimental checkpoint and delivery audit

The combined full-module candidate measured 90.0806 -> 82.6492 ms in the uncapped r101 square (ticks 1330:1389, 60
frames, stride 1, tail 3; ACT_CAP=0 / PACE_MODE=off; SH-4-model CPU work excluding waits). Seven controlled schema-5
source/candidate pairs pass 24,279 complete state/decision/effect frames. This is not 30 fps, natural-transition,
visual or physical-console acceptance. The r104 inventory looked broken in both controls. Correction (local session, 2026-10-04): that was 6819f3a2's bug,
already fixed on dreamcast-port. Since ad0c59d0 (PS2_WORLD_ROOMS=2) the inventory's rigid models were taken for room
scenery and the PS2 world was submitted inside the sub screen's single TR stream. Both controls predate the fix, so
source and candidate showed it alike; these experiments did not cause it. The knob set is recorded in
[SUPERVISOR_BASELINE_20261004.md](SUPERVISOR_BASELINE_20261004.md) ("Knob set of the 82.65 ms candidate").

Source checkpoints 4386239f and 3739a8e0 are on experiment/supervisor-20261004. The latter preserves a default-off
early-admission experiment that lost 6.1125 ms and must not be enabled. No play recipe change. The diagnostic
16f0da96 has since landed on dreamcast-port.

The supervisor did not follow incremental delivery promptly. A rejected publication attempt remained unresolved while
local work accumulated. Live GitHub verification shows lamb2k/re4dc is public, contradicting the old private
description; the publication question now explicitly states that fact. The remote was ce39455f at audit time. See
[delivery audit](SUPERVISOR_DELIVERY_AUDIT_20261004.md) and [combined baseline](SUPERVISOR_BASELINE_20261004.md) for
results and preserved failures.

## 2026-10-04: review of 2026-10-03/04

Review of the dreamcast-port commits b802e337..80912a72 and the unmerged experiment/supervisor-20261004: code reading,
host tests, a trial merge; no SH-4 build (cloud session).
- **r21t GDEMU image boots in Flycast.** The released RE4DC-r21t-GDEMU.zip (sha256 328478cf..., every file matching its
  SHA256SUMS) booted from disc.gdi in Flycast 2.4 (Linux AppImage, built-in HLE BIOS, software GL under Xvfb; cloud
  session): the game's VMU system-info prompt at 10 s; after A, the Sofdec, Dolby and resident evil logos and the title
  (START / LOAD / OPTIONS); after New Game, r100 gameplay with the HUD at ~272 s, Leon walking. No crash screen, no
  Flycast error, no disc-read error; the log holds only boot notices and the game's KOS banner. disc.gdi (CRLF): three
  tracks, track03 at LBA 45000 with 458,647 raw 2352-byte Mode 1 sectors, valid sync and LBA headers at both ends
  (45000..503646), all 1,143 files inside track03. Not established: GDEMU's own TOC handling, a console, audio, speed
  (software rendering drew r100 at 8-14 fps). To check: a root file LE_MIRROR_REPORT.JSON (1.45 MB, a tool report)
  ships on the disc.
- **Inventory:** the corruption fixed by 6819f3a2 came in with ad0c59d0 (PS2_WORLD_ROOMS=2, 2026-09-29), so it was very
  likely in every play disc from r21i to r21s, the public r21k, r21l and r21m included; the route checks count HALT /
  MISSING and never open the inventory. Play discs now run an inventory open/close check (checklist "Play build rules").
- **TA_HASH** (16f0da96) does not cover the actor fast path's whole meshlets: correction in the 2026-10-03 section.
- **TEX_PACK retries** (766a5fa5): back-to-back attempts, no re-arm before the first room, a truncated pack never
  INVALID: "Pack failure policy" below.
- **Recipe hygiene:** five recipe knobs were read by no makefile (COARSE_WORLD_LAYERS, MOTION_HASH,
  NATIVE_STATIC_PROBE_SKIP, PS2_SOURCE_SPANS, SOURCE_CENSUS; all 0), which resolved-knobs.txt cannot show;
  route-build.sh only warns without resolved-knobs.txt, although 8f34aa63's message says it fails.
- **Diagnostics only** (no play image effect): the WP2 census "read-only twins" (446f05a5, 59d2eab3) repeat calls that
  have side effects (ATD 22 counted twice, a binding-revision slot, re-adoption under CROWD_READOPT=2, the material log
  budgets spent), so ACTOR_TRANSACTION_DIAG=1 counts and the DIAG `late 0x10` arm differ from DIAG=0; the decisions
  and the 7.09 ms pair (DIAG=0 cost builds) are unaffected. Late bit 0x04 never resets its pacing override.
  hwwork.py can print a stale STRICT verdict when logic_trace_diff.py fails. A `--tail` run can wait for its deadline
  when frames stop.
- **Host suite:** 356 tests on 80912a72, 16 failing there and on 06e71078 alike: 12 host fixtures that no longer
  compile against current code, and 4 guards (both "PowerPC source unchanged" checks: read.cpp RE4DC_HALT_STORE,
  motion.cpp u16_un; the linked-enemy reader rule: em27; the room dependency gate). Nothing new broke and WP0 fixed one
  failure, but a guard that is always red cannot catch a new violation.
- **experiment/supervisor-20261004:** a trial merge onto 80912a72 conflicts only in two docs and keeps 6819f3a2; the
  guards hold (one unguarded DBG_WARP=1-only change in dbgwarp_bridge.cpp); no defect found in the registry pack check,
  registry lifetime, swap park or trace region view; its host tests pass where they need no private data. Before it
  lands: its "r104 inventory, cause not isolated" paragraphs (SUPERVISOR_* docs and its route/checklist entries)
  describe 6819f3a2's bug; the 82.65 ms candidate's knob set is not in the repo; 038d1c59 is a 62-file snapshot with
  an empty body labelled "local only", yet on the public remote; the r104 inventory needs a re-capture on the merged
  tree.
- **Follow-up branch lane/review-fixes-20261004** (docs/lanes/review-fixes.md; not landed): TEX_PACK retry spacing
  and short_file -> INVALID, the TA_HASH whole-meshlet hook, the native_static `#error` guard, build-r21.sh's
  dead-knob check (the five knobs dropped) and route-build.sh's hard failure. Host-tested only: the local session
  runs the target gates, lands it and cuts r21u.
- **User decisions (2026-10-04):** (1) experiment/supervisor-20261004's code lands default-off once its docs are
  corrected, its 82.65 ms knob set is recorded and 038d1c59 is split into described commits, after r21u (local
  session); play-recipe adoption of any of it stays a separate decision. (2) Gameplay-logic cost (G) is parked behind
  render work until the console calibration (disc c8); the perf plan is re-planned with calibrated numbers then.
- **30 fps status** (hwsim, uncalibrated; per image): H2 ~49.6 ms work a tick with the adopted knobs; r101 square
  82.65 ms on the unmerged candidate; kite fight 88.4 at its last measurement (2026-09-28). G alone in fights is ~29
  against 24, and no lane owns G since the architect review voided "G closed". Calibration disc c8 still awaits a
  console run.

## 2026-10-04: r21t public play downloads

User-authorized public release:
play-r21t-inventory-fix-20261004 (release removed 2026-10-04 with the other pre-r21v releases; the tag stays).
Windows, SteamOS, CachyOS and GDEMU archives package the already verified r21t images. Every archived
file is read back and hash-checked; GitHub asset digests and sizes match the local release manifest.
SHA256SUMS.txt and inline release-note hashes support manual and existing scripted downloads.
The runtime remains 6819f3a2, ELF b9dc7b75819fb03e; packaging fix 0b9f6a35. No game-code rebuild or new
performance claim accompanies publication. The continuous chapter playthrough, GDI boot test,
physical-console acceptance and separate SteamOS/CachyOS runtime checks remain pending.

## 2026-10-04: inventory room-replacement ownership repair

The approved 16f0da96 play code reproduces the broken inventory in r100 and r104 with the title-c14 pack.
SS_PACK=0 reproduces it too. Inventory rigid models carry static_geometry; PS2_WORLD_ROOMS=2 therefore
mistook them for the first room-scene draw and submitted the PS2 world inside SS_UI_ORDER's single TR
stream. This closed that list and sent later UI parts through CLOSED_PASS_KEEP, corrupting the case,
items, menu bars and Leon preview. The missing inventory texture was a separate packaging issue.

native_static now uses the existing re4dc_ss_ui_order owner query to exclude swapped subscreen models
from room replacement. subscreen.mk supplies the existing generated setting to that object. No new
renderer, gameplay change, experimental optimization, or play-recipe knob is introduced.

Validation: the same assets before/after show the inventory restored in both rooms; each 180-second
Flycast run opens and closes it, restores the saved area with the matching hash, and returns to gameplay
with HALT 0 / MISSING 0. The matched source/fix gameplay trace pair passes STRICT for 1,804 r100 frames
(room offsets 0..1803, anchors 182/182), no gaps or duplicates, ACT_CAP=0 / PACE_MODE=off. This trace
covers ordinary gameplay, not the swapped inventory memory; the inventory gate is visual plus restore
checks. Production and traced builds report zero missing stubs.

The new title-invfix pack adds the already recovered cd5691f8-b993e9b1 material (656 bytes); all 3,241
existing package payloads are byte-identical. The production image uses the current play recipe,
DBG_WARP=0 / PC_SAMPLER=0 / GAME_PWC_DIAG=1 / PACE_MODE=fast / PACE_DEBUG=1. The final pack passes two inventory open/close cycles in each room with matching restore hashes,
zero missing packages and zero upload failures. The production title/New Game run completes the three
opening movies (1971/1971, 2360/2360 and 1175/1175 pictures) and reaches r100 gameplay.

The existing chapter-end fixture starts in r106: its ending movie plays 1738/1738, the chapter 1-1
results and Save prompt appear, VMU save and syswrite return 0, and r104 is entered. Its s00 movie
finishes and the expected missed-QTE branch reaches Continue. These checks are separate endpoints,
not a continuous manual title-to-chapter-end playthrough or QTE-success qualification.

r21t is installed locally: C:/RE4DC-Play-Discs/r21t-title/disc.cue and r21t-gdemu/disc.gdi; launcher
D:/RE4DC-Play/Play-r21t-Inventory-Fix.cmd. Runtime source is 6819f3a2; production ELF SHA-256 begins
b9dc7b75819fb03e. CUE disc SHA-256 is 226db5f2b4cadc91ee350b325c6a15db17b1cac463b740d853a44894d324bddf.
The CUE has 458649 logical sectors. The newly authored GDI has 458647 raw 2352-byte data sectors at
LBA 45000; all 1143 file payloads match, with the expected unscrambled boot-program difference.

GDI packaging now accepts INPUT_CHARSET (legacy iso8859-1 default unchanged). The UTF-8 tree extracted
from the tested CUE is packaged with INPUT_CHARSET=utf-8, preserving one legacy text filename that
the first draft re-encoded. Both drafts remain private; only the fully verified UTF-8 image is delivered.
The packager change does not change the compiled game. Final evidence: delivery-report-r21t.json and
r21t-gdemu-utf8-verification.json in the private playable-first directory.
The first route milestone remains title -> r120 -> r100 -> r101 bell -> r103 -> r106 results/save -> r104.
Later emblem/key pickups and full chapter-route acceptance are still unproven; this repair does not
establish 30 fps or physical-console acceptance.

Evidence: private architect-review-20261003/tools/supervisor-20261003/playable-first/; scenarios
route-play-main-r100-inventory-r1, route-play-main-r104-inventory-r1,
route-play-main-r104-inventory-unpacked-r1, route-play-invfix-r100-r2, route-play-invfix-r104-r2,
route-play-inv-control-strict-r1 and route-play-inv-fix-strict-r1. The first repair prototype omitted the
native_static generated-header dependency and compiled the check out; it is retained as a failed check.

## 2026-10-03: native vertex coverage in graphics diagnostics

`TA_HASH` now includes the direct store-queue strips emitted by `vp::emit_sq` (PS2 world/mesh fast path)
and the native actor fast path. Previously both bypassed `re4dc_ta_put`, so matching hashes did not cover
their vertex data. The diagnostic hashes the copied words with the final vertex's EOL flag. Direct
store-queue writes in `coarse.cpp` and `coarse_world.cpp` are still outside this coverage.

This repair compiles out with the normal `TA_HASH=0`. On a standalone ce39455f-based image, fresh
`sup-ps-id-base` vs `sup-ps-sq-off` builds have identical .text/.data/overlay, .bss (803644 bytes) and
`_end` (8c3afffc); only four __TIME__ bytes differ. `sup-ps-sq-t1` with TA_HASH=1 also builds with zero
missing symbols. The enabled hooks ran in the stacked diagnostic route checks, including 3754 matched
r101 frames; the standalone TA_HASH=1 image is build-verified, not separately route-tested.

Evidence: private architect-review-20261003/tools/supervisor-20261003/pass-share/ARCHIVE.md,
sqfix.log, sqfix2.log and tacmp-k.txt. This does not adopt PS2_PASS_SHARE (parked after mixed cost
results), change the play recipe, establish complete TA equivalence against the old baseline, or
claim a performance/physical-console result. Native scene coverage remains under implementation.

Correction (review 2026-10-04): the actor fast path is only partly covered. Its whole meshlets (`Part::whole` ->
`emit_meshlet<true>`, the common case under NATIVE_ACTOR_DIRECT=1, also in the COARSE_ONE_SUBMIT window) still go
to the store queues unhashed, so matching `ta_hash:` lines do not prove matching actor geometry. The hook is on
lane/review-fixes-20261004 (docs/lanes/review-fixes.md), not landed. Merging experiment/supervisor-20261004 would
add MESH_STRIP_LEAN paths that also bypass or misattribute the hash (=1/=3 write the store queues in their own
assembly; =2 hashes a dry-run copy that never reaches the TA). Settled when it landed: =1/=3 hashed, =2 refuses
TA_HASH ("supervisor code landed default-off").

Active since 2026-09-23 (Claude, user-directed). This document supersedes the
paused D366 handover and the "beat D349" sequence as the current plan. Earlier
checkpoints remain evidence.

## Goals and decision rules (user)

- **Target: 30 fps on a real Dreamcast.** Flycast is a proxy. It counts issued
  instructions and has no cache or latency model. It does not enforce TA or VRAM
  capacity.
- **Decide by frame time.** Every option states its ms/frame impact as:
  - a real-hardware estimate against the 33 ms frame;
  - the measured Flycast figure, noting the 16.7 ms vblank quantisation.

  Take the fastest option whose visual difference is negligible. A modest cost
  is acceptable only when the result looks substantially better.
- **GameCube rendering tech may be abandoned** for Dreamcast-native approaches,
  including new or simplified assets and PS2-derived art. Collision, events,
  game sequencing and gameplay state stay source-authoritative.
- **An ODE (GDEMU) may be required.** Ship GDI with 2048-byte data tracks, not
  CDI. Design for ms-class latency and 1.5-3 MB/s sustained reads, all async
  and prefetched. The G1 bus caps reads at about 10 MB/s.
  - Disc artifacts (architect review 2026-10-03). "2048-byte data tracks" means 2048-byte MODE1 user data; the
    stored sector size differs between the two images. The GDEMU image (`stage.sh GDI=1` / mkgdi.sh,
    `SECTOR=2352` default; e.g. r21s-gdemu) has three tracks with raw 2352-byte sectors (16-byte sync + header,
    2048 user bytes, EDC/ECC); track 3 starts at LBA 45000. The Flycast play image (e.g. r21s-title `disc.cue`) is one MODE1/2048 track of 2048-byte logical
    sectors. Same data-track sector count (r21s: 458,648). Sector n of the data track is at byte n x 2352 + 16 of
    track03.bin (GD LBA 45000 + n) and at byte n x 2048 of disc.bin.
    A Flycast boot of the CUE image does not validate the GDEMU TOC, the raw tracks or physical media.
- **Floating point:** `-ffp-contract=off` everywhere was approved (logic plan
  step 6B). Recapture the determinism baseline once. After that, O2 changes
  must be strictly identical.
  - GAME_FDLIBM=1 (contract-off trig built from the recovered newlib sources)
    goes in the same step.
  - Render-only native renderer objects are exempt, saving about 0.5 ms on
    hardware.
  - KOS flushes denormals (FPSCR), so O2 isn't identical by construction. The
    STRICT trace gate decides.
- **Hardware test gate:**
  - No console testing until the recovered game plays r100 -> r101 -> r103
    through normal transitions, with cutscenes, music, sound effects,
    inventory and death/retry.
  - Flycast must reach about 15 fps first.
  - The test kit is a GDEMU and a VMU, with no serial link. Diagnostics go on
    the VMU LCD (dca3 style) and an on-screen PERF_HUD with the logic digest.
- **Cutscenes must play.** Skipping them loses story context. Present each
  route event with its PS2 pre-rendered movie (BIO4MOV.AFS) while the GC event
  code applies every gameplay effect. Build on branch
  `experiment/ps2-fmv-spike`: it has the menu, the intro FMV with audio, and
  the route entry. Its FMV state is largely uncommitted in that worktree.

## Hardware readiness (2026-10-02)

User asked for a pass over what could stop the game on a real console. Flycast runs some code a Dreamcast
does not, so r21m, clean in every Flycast test, would have crashed on hardware in the first minutes of r100:
- **Misaligned accesses** (the SH-4 raises an address error; Flycast without its MMU performs them). An
  alignment-checking interpreter Flycast found 17 PCs on the new-game route: cCtrl's work at 0x13 (Ctrl11 /
  Ctrl12 / ctrl01), and the u16 arrays motion, camera-motion and shape data keep at offset 3 plus Hermite key
  counts / frames after odd-stride key blocks. Fixed off the PowerPC only: work at 0x14, `u16_un` (types.h).
  The fixed build logs 0 over every route room (r100-r107, movies, VMU saves, QTE, manual).
- **Memory never written**, **vertex buffer size** and **no logs without a serial cable**: POISON_RAM runs match
  r21m; TA peak 1.67 MB of input in the r101 fight against the 2 MB buffer; CRASH_SCREEN=1.
- **User decisions:** CRASH_SCREEN is in every play build (build-r21.sh), and the screen asks the player to
  raise a ticket with a photo (github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/issues).
- Gates for the fixes + crash screen against r21m (pc12w): kite frame 2100 identical (heap 4 -12,288 B);
  bridge, r105, chapter end and r107 game state identical apart from heap figures.
- Rule from now on: run `tools/d367/hwready/route-hw.sh align` over any new room or data format before a console
  disc (tools/d367/hwready/README.md).

## Radio calls and the cliff cutscene (2026-10-02, user play of r21n)

The user played r21n and reported slow loading after cutscenes and calls, and the radio missing in some cutscenes.
From the play log (D:\RE4DC-Play\logs\game-20261002-163147.txt):
- **Calls.** The sub screen (call, inventory, map) parks 3 MiB of live game memory while it is open: 2 MiB in TA
  bank 1 and 1 MiB in one contiguous texture-pool block. Carving that block out of a full, fragmented pool released
  159-211 room textures (2.2-2.3 MB), and the preload after the close reloaded 207-209 of them (5.4-5.9 s of disc
  reads) after every call.
  **SS_PACK=1** (subscreen.mk): the area is stored LZ4-block packed (the VMU codec's format; 4096-entry table,
  64 KiB window, LZ4 skip), 3,144,608 -> 1,824,352 B in the r100 post-house call (1.72:1), so it fits bank 1 and
  takes no pool memory. If a later state packs worse, pool blocks are taken as the stream grows (free memory first,
  then the least recently used textures), never one contiguous MiB. The encoder's table and staging sit in the
  area's first 8.5 KiB, which go raw first and are put back before anything else reads the area. Same bytes back:
  the close checks the hash taken at open. Route run route-pk1 (r100 s20 + ambush + post-house call): textures
  released 0, preload after the close none (route-hs20 without it: 209 reloaded in 5.4 s). Open 583 ms and close 246 ms
  in Flycast with the LZ4 skip and bulk literal copies (route-s30a; 656 / 349 ms without them; the plain backing
  75 / 68 ms): about 0.8 s per call instead of ~5.5 s.
- **The cliff cutscene (r100 s30, area 01: face west at the cliff edge and press A).** Its movie needs 363 KB of
  heap-4 staging in pieces of up to 166 KB. After the ambush heap 4 had 257,568-313,504 B free with no 83 KB piece, so
  the movie failed (terminal=3) and the cutscene was skipped silently.
  **MOVIE_HEAP_EVICT=1** (game30.mk, needs MOTION_OOM_EVICT and ROUTE_MOVIES): a movie staging allocation that
  fails evicts unpinned motion keys, least recently used first, and retries. The movie owns the frame, so nothing
  animates (true for blocking movies such as this s30 cliff; not for stepped / QTE movies, see the 2026-10-03
  correction below); evicted keys reload from disc at their next use, as with MOTION_OOM_EVICT. Each of the decoder's two frames is also split into its three planes (largest piece 55,296 B; pl_mpeg local
  option PLM_VIDEO_SPLIT_FRAMES), and the sound service's 32,800 B separation buffer gets the same eviction first.
  Route run route-s30d (r100 s20 + ambush + post-house call + the cliff, A at area 01): 17 motion keys evicted
  (251,360 B), the movie plays 340/340 with audio (dropped 0, HALT 0, MISSING 0) and the game continues into the
  examine view ("I hope they got out in time."). With whole frames (route-s30b) the same 17 keys went and no 83 KB
  piece appeared; with planes but no room for the buffer (route-s30c) the sound service could not start.
- Both knobs are in the play recipe (build-r21.sh); with them off the image is unchanged.
- 2026-10-03 (TEX_PACK builds, r21r): the route reached the cliff at another frame and the LRU keys (166 KB)
  never joined into the second 55,296 B luma plane: 197 KB free, largest hole 40,736 B, the cutscene skipped
  (route-pak7). The failure-only free map (route-hm1) put that hole next to the 131,168 B model preparation
  cache, rebuilt every frame and idle while the movie owns it. MOVIE_HEAP_EVICT now lends that cache first and
  allocates it again when the movie retires: route-hm4 / route-hm3 play 340/340, cache back, HALT 0.
- Correction (architect review 2026-10-03; f845b301, 68d3b05a):
  - **Blocking vs stepped movies.** A blocking movie (the r100 s30 cliff) owns the frame:
    no game frame draws while it plays. A stepped / QTE movie (r104s00) does not: game frames keep drawing and may
    ask for the lent cache during the loan.
  - **"Cache back" means re-acquisition was attempted**, not that capacity returned. The loan is now owned by
    ui_bridge.cpp (f845b301): while lent, a model draw is refused and counted without latching its one attempt.
    At retirement the log says "model preparation cache back (N B), K model draws asked during the loan", or
    "cache back FAILED (0 B) ... the next model draw retries". Before f845b301 a failed re-allocation latched the
    attempt and the cache never came back for the rest of the session.
  - **Stepped-movie gate: open.** MOVIE_LOAN_TEST=1 (test only, default 0) lends the cache at each movie's first
    staging allocation. On the r104 QTE fixture no cache is held when the movies start (0 B to lend), so the
    stepped case is not reproduced in Flycast. The r100 s30 cliff run shows the blocking loan: lent 131,072 B,
    back 131,072 B, 0 draws asked.
- Also from the same play: the house ambush runs 12-17 fps, and outdoors Fast pacing draws 17.7 fps by skipping
  about 2 frames in 5 (each drawn frame ~43 ms against the 33 ms tick), which reads as skippy. Hold R + START cycles
  Smooth / Fast / Off.

## Skewed wall textures and the closed-pass crash (2026-10-03, user play of r21o)

The user: "the texture on the wall looks like floor", "the textures on the first house look backwards", "game also
crashes". Live frames from the user's Flycast showed the r100 house wainscot (texture 0038, vertical board seams)
drawn with diagonal seams, and the floor smeared.
- **Cause: the LOD simplifier, not the PS2 data.** The OBJ export maps every 0038 face straight (8 of 8 at 0 degrees).
  mesh_lod.py's quadric collapse judges geometry only; on a flat wall every collapse is free, and a corner moved
  across a UV seam or a tiling restart gets its UV extrapolated and clamped, which shears the texture. It happens at
  every distance: level 0 is the `--lod-floor 2.0` level, already simplified.
- **Fix: `--lod-uv-guard 0.002`** (ps2_room_r4im.py and ps2_world_r4im.py -> mesh_lod.UV_GUARD; default off, so the
  shipped packages still rebuild byte-identical: all seven reproduced). A collapse is refused when a surviving
  corner's new UV leaves its triangle's own mapping by more than the tolerance. Level-0 triangles: r100 68,261 ->
  70,231, r101 47,772 -> 49,565, r103 41,507 -> 42,558, r104 24,881 -> 26,228, r105 29,734 -> 32,653, r106 41,802
  -> 44,226, r107 36,222 -> 39,256; every package gets smaller (fewer coarse levels pass min_gain). Packages
  `<room>-uvg` / `<room>-ps2-uvg` / `world-mesh-r21/package-uvg` in the store (re4mesh sha256 r100 508e5ba2,
  r101 50d1d1e5, r103 b98d867c, r104 d44ed564, r105 35205b01, r106 99e01506, r107 3887749a); play fixture
  `tour/play/title-c13-pw.json` = c12 with the 14 package entries swapped.
- Look: route-uvhb / route-uvhg (Leon placed in the house facing each wall): the window-wall and back-wall wainscot
  straight, the floor planks no longer smeared. Cost (Flycast draw ms per drawn frame, same fixture): r100 house
  route mean 41.49 -> 41.84, worst window +1.1; r101 entry fight steady windows +0.6..+1.3 (12.1 -> 12.0 fps).
- **Crash:** "RE4DC MISSING: native closed pass requested" in r100 right after an A press (PS2PASS closed from=2 to=0:
  an opaque draw after the translucent list opened; the PVR cannot reopen a closed list). **CLOSED_PASS_KEEP=1**
  (game30.mk, render only, in build-r21.sh) keeps the packet in the open list (the TA latches the list type at the
  list's first header, so the packet draws with its own blend) and logs "PS2PASS kept ... ra=" for the root fix. The
  late opaque caller is still unknown. Correction (architect review 2026-10-03): CLOSED_PASS_KEEP is a
  crash-avoidance fallback, not proof of correct rendering. Ordering, alpha and depth for a kept opaque or
  punch-through packet in the translucent list are unresolved; each caller needs its own visual gate.
- **Loading (same play):** after the s03 and s20 cutscenes the area change reloads 157 / 203 textures (4.9 / 6.1 s), and
  running around loads 644 more while the pool is full (2.44 MB budget). TEX_USE_CENSUS=1 (test only) counts the
  resident set the last 2 s / 20 s drew: at the r100 cliff 146 of 178 resident textures (1.69 of 2.13 MB) were idle
  for 20 s; on the r100 east walk 103 of the 105 room-archive textures (896 of 921 KB) were idle. In a PS2 world
  room the room archive's textures are the GameCube scenery the PS2 world replaces, and the Standard index's shells
  and impostor atlases are not drawn either, yet the room preload loaded them first and the PS2 world's own
  textures loaded on first sight.
- **PS2_PRELOAD_LEAN=1** (game30.mk, render only, in build-r21.sh): with the room's PS2 world package open, the
  room pass preloads the package's own textures instead (r100: 59 loads, 2.4 s, in place of 141, 4.1 s); the room
  archive's textures load on first sight if an object draws them. r100 s20 + ambush + call + cliff (route-tuse2 ->
  route-lean1): preload 457 loads / 16.3 s -> 134 / 7.2 s, first-sight loads 298 -> 150, the area change after the
  s20 cutscene 141 loads / 4.1 s -> 4 / 0.6 s, the route reaches the cliff ~30 s earlier. r100 east walk
  (route-tuse3 -> route-lean2): preload 8.2 -> 6.5 s, first-sight loads 48 -> 28, evictions 73 -> 0; draw ms
  26.40 -> 26.33. HALT 0, MISSING 0, screenshots fully textured.
- Still per file after that: the room entry's ~130 loads took 6.5 s in Flycast (~50 ms each). IO_PROBE: 130 opens
  were 3.9 s of it, each a directory lookup (234 directory-sector reads) in dc/tex/<n>/.
- **TEX_PACK=1** (game30.mk, in build-r21.sh; design-doorload U4 step 1): every dc/tex package of the disc in one
  file, dc/tex.pak (tools/d367/texpack.py: 2048-byte header, an index sorted by (crc, fnv), the packages byte for
  byte at 2048-byte boundaries). The runtime keeps the first key of each index sector (20 sectors for 2,512
  packages, 160 B); a lookup reads one index sector, a load opens the pack and seeks to its package. Keys not in the
  pack (texlow, absent) and discs without one take the per-file path. Play discs stage the derived fixture:
  `tools/d367/route/pack-fixture.sh <fixture> <arm> <out fixture>` stages the fixture once, packs its disc and
  writes a fixture that adds dc/tex.pak and removes the packed loose files (texlow/ and the media overlay's stay).
  Same bytes uploaded, same loads: r100 s20..cliff (route-lean1 -> route-pak7) preload 7.2 -> 3.1 s; east walk
  (route-lean2 -> route-pak8) 6.5 -> 2.7 s; HALT 0, MISSING 0, no rejects, screenshots fully textured.
  Trap (route-pak3): a sector-aligned read into a 32-byte aligned buffer is a KOS CD DMA stream; on a long-lived
  index handle it stayed open and an audio-stream start then failed a texture upload ("Previous DMA request is in
  progress"). Unaligned reads avoid the stream but cost ~16 ms a sector (route-pak5: preload 4.5 s). Index reads
  now go through re4dc::texture::read_file_range: its own handle, closed before returning, after the IO_SERIAL wait.
- **Pack failure policy (architect review 2026-10-03; 766a5fa5, 13eaccec).** "Per file after a pack failure" is
  only safe on a loose-file disc: play discs made by pack-fixture.sh drop the packed loose files.
  - **Absent** (fs_open fails): per-file loads, as before. Fine on a loose-file disc.
  - **Read error** (header, an index sector at init, or a lookup's sector): no texture this time; the key is not
    marked missing, nothing is evicted, the loose file is not probed. Init retries 3 times, then once per room load.
  - **Invalid** (bad magic / version / count / offsets / extents / key order / index CRC): one loud
    "tex pack: ... INVALID: <why>" line, then per-file loads. On a packed-only disc that means missing textures.
  - Known weakness (measured in Flycast): if 3 header reads fail in a room that never changes,
    that room has no pack textures until the next room load.
  - Review 2026-10-04: the 3 attempts run back to back (one lookup burst, e.g. a room preload, spends them all);
    nothing re-arms them before the first room after boot (re4dc_room_leave returns early without a live room heap),
    so the title and the first room can stay without pack textures; a pack shorter than its header reads as a read
    error forever instead of INVALID; a failed lookup sector is re-read and logged on every use. Fix (spaced retries
    in UI frames, short_file -> INVALID, per-sector re-read spacing) on lane/review-fixes-20261004, not landed. Also
    open: "absent" is any fs_open failure (a handle shortage or directory read error reads as no pack for the
    session; on a packed-only disc its keys then end in missing_keys).
  - Tools: `texpack.py --verify <pak>` runs the runtime's checks plus each package's magic. pack-fixture.sh
    (13eaccec) writes content-addressed verified packs `<name>.<sha16>.pak` with a provenance manifest beside
    them, and refuses to overwrite an output fixture without `--replace`.
- Next for loading (U4 step 2): coalesce a room's preload into a few long reads (its packages are scattered over
  the pack; ordering the pack by room would make the room pass one sequential read).

## Hardware budget

Sources are the official Sega documents (catalogue and citations in the
private probe `dc-official-docs/REPORT.md`) and the dca3-game source.

**Render rate.** Sega's real-world figure is 1 M polys/s for 100-pixel
triangles, about 33k triangles per frame at 30 fps.
- Plan about 20-24k scenery triangles and 6-8k actor triangles.
- That is 50-65k strip vertices per frame.

**VRAM parameter cost** (Dev.Box 3.7.9). Stored cost is 12 B per sub-strip,
plus per vertex:

| Vertex format | Bytes per vertex |
|---|---|
| Textured, 16-bit UV | 20 B |
| Textured, 32-bit UV or offset colour | 24 B |
| Textured, 32-bit UV and offset colour | 28 B |

- At Strip_Len 6 that is 28.7-39.3 B per triangle.
- TA input is 32 B per vertex; don't confuse the two.
- The TA guard must count stored bytes.

**Vertex buffer.** It is a pvr_init VRAM allocation, not a hardware constant.
- dca3 uses 2 MiB per bank x2 with an adaptive per-meshlet guard.
- Historical (2026-09-23): "We currently use 1 MiB, which r100 exceeds on hardware even after LOD. Larger buffers
  are blocked by UI texture VRAM: the UI cache holds 3.0-3.6 MB at the title screen." Superseded by UI_VRAM=1
  + tex-vq3 (700e2d0, item 16 below).
- Current (architect review 2026-10-03): the reviewed recipe (build-r21.sh) uses `TA_VERTBUF_KB=2048` with
  `TA_DOUBLEBUF=1`, i.e. 2 MiB x 2 TA banks, sharing VRAM with the UI texture pool. While a sub screen is open the
  TA drops to one bank and the sub screen owns bank 1: SS_PACK=1 packs its 3 MiB area LZ4 into bank 1 (r100
  post-house call 1,824,352 B) and takes pool blocks only if a state packs worse. Capacity evidence: TA input
  peak 1.67 MB in the r101 fight against the 2 MiB bank ("Hardware readiness").

**Overflow.** A parameter or object-list overflow means that frame cannot be
drawn. Kamui never overflows.

**CPU.** One SH-4 core carries logic and rendering in the same 33 ms.
- Estimated cycles per vertex:
  - prelit scenery: 30-45;
  - lit geometry: 45-70;
  - skinned actors: 70-120.
- Timings: FTRV 1 per 4 cycles; FDIV 12-13 cycles.

## Measured progression (Flycast, r100, frames 2401-2520)

| Candidate | ms/frame | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Q | 559 | |
| S | 409 | NO_EH (f10ed71) |
| T | 234 | Meshlet fast path (02d5a0f), dense actor path (bfa1452) |
| U | 217 | Spatial meshlet packages |
| V2 | 200 | pipeline30: PVR_FAST_WAKE, BRIDGE_LEAN, PVR_PIPELINE=1 |
| LA | 150 | scenery30: MESH_LOD=1 MESH_LOD_PX=3 NATIVE_FOG=1 (LOD packages, GX fog as PVR table fog to the 42.7 m source far plane) |
| LB | 150 | Lightly reduced GC trees; about 2 ms less work, same vblank step |
| LC | 117 | actors30: NATIVE_ACTOR_FAST=1 NATIVE_ACTOR_SKIN=1; actors about 51 -> 18 ms |
| LD | 117 | PS2 trees (ps2-blender stage.sh overlay). About 2.5 ms less work; COMMON package 507 -> 136 KB, so heap 4 gains ~370 KB. **Chosen.** |
| LE | 117-119 | PS2 "groves" variant. 6% more TA data; a few more background trunks; the visual gain is negligible. Rejected by the frame-time rule. |
| LF | 117 | LD + async present (PVR_PIPELINE=2, KOS patch `kos-804b319-async-present`). Work ~96 ms plus ~6 ms fence wait still lands on the 100 ms+ vblank step, so Flycast shows no change. **Adopted as the default**: the better architecture (CPU no longer waits on render), per the user's rule. |
| FE | 100 | LD + frontend30 (COPY_LEAN, FRONT_LEAN, MESH_DIRECT+TA_DIRECT+NATIVE_ACTOR_DIRECT; de03f28): work 95.9 -> 79.9 ms, one vblank step fewer. The logic trace is STRICT. Being re-validated on LF. |
| LG | 100 | LF + frontend30 + printf pass (f52746a). Hardware model: **158.1 -> 131.3 ms** (-26.8); Flycast work 95.8 -> 78.9. STRICT; safe under async present. Game30 knobs not yet included (integration run LH pending). |

Remaining work in LC is about 98 ms. It rounds up to 7 vblanks.

| Area | ms/frame |
|---|---|
| Game-side CPU | ~36 |
| Actors | ~21 |
| Scenery | ~19 |
| Memory copies | ~12-15 |
| Vblank pacing waste | ~19 idle |

## Hardware projection (SH-4 model, 2026-09-23)

The model: an interpreter-mode Flycast trace of LD, frames 2401-2520 (30 frames fully traced), replayed through an SH-4 timing model built from the Sega/SH-4 manuals. It covers pairing and latencies, the 8 KB I-cache and 16 KB D-cache with copy-back, miss penalties, the shared bus, and store queues. PVR/DMA bus contention is not modelled, so the figures lean low. Uncalibrated until console microbenchmarks run.

**LD work projects to ~158 ms/frame on hardware (137-187; quote 130-195) against ~96 ms in Flycast: real hardware costs about 1.65x Flycast.** That is ~4.7x over the 33 ms budget, not ~2.9x.

| Area | Flycast | HW nominal (range) | of which I-miss / D-miss |
|---|---|---|---|
| GC code on render thread (model/light setup, matrices, GX stubs) | 19.7 | 37.3 (31.6-44.9) | 8.3 / 2.0 |
| Actors | 20.6 | 34.5 (31.2-38.9) | 3.0 / 3.7 |
| Scenery | 17.7 | 31.4 (27.6-36.2) | 3.9 / 5.0 |
| Game logic | 15.5 | 25.8 (22.3-30.5) | 5.4 / 1.2 |
| UI / texture cache (native_ui.cpp) | 5.5 | 12.3 (10.0-15.1) | 2.3 / 0.5 |
| Copies | 10.9 | 8.3 (7.6-9.1) | 0.5 / 1.1 |
| TA submission | 4.0 | 5.0 (3.7-7.7) | |
| KOS | 0.6 | 3.3 | |
| **Total** | **~95** | **157.8 (136.7-186.6)** | 24.8 / 14.2 |

Ranked hardware levers:
1. copies, up to 8.75 ms;
2. direct store-queue vertex writes and movca.l staging, 7-8 ms;
3. instruction scheduling and FTRV in hot render asm, ceiling 28.8 ms, realistic 30-50% of it;
4. UI texture-cache O(1) handles, 8-10 ms;
5. fsrra, ~1.4 ms;
6. GC render front-end reduction, worth ~1.7x its Flycast gain.

Not worth doing:
- hot/cold link ordering (+1.2 ms worse);
- OC-RAM (net 1.4-3.2 ms);
- OIX (+17.8 ms; never enable it);
- pref in loops (0.4 ms);
- game-object data packing (at most ~1 ms).

Game logic alone is ~26 ms on hardware, so a 33 ms frame leaves almost nothing for rendering. See "Plan to 30 fps".

Tools: port/dreamcast/tools/hwmodel (24ba078). `hwproject.sh <dir>` projects any candidate in about 6 minutes.

Current stack (LF + frontend30 + UI_VRAM 2048 + tex-vq3) projects to **130.3 ms (114.7-151.1)** against LD's 157.8. Hardware keeps 172% of the Flycast gain.
By area: render-side 32.3, actors 31.1, scenery 27.2, logic 24.7, UI 8.5, copies 3.6, TA 0.3, KOS 2.5.

### D349 on hardware (hwmodel-d349)

D349 (5f42caa, the r100 autoplay prototype: reduced gameplay, sampled camera and animation) projects to **76.3 ms on hardware** (Flycast 53.4). It is not cheaper per unit of work:
- actors cost 2.69 hardware ms per 1k TA vertex records, against our 1.28;
- scenery costs 2.20, against our 1.42.

It draws less (0.87 MB TA/frame vs 1.40 MB) and runs almost no game logic, UI or GC front end. Those three are ~65 ms of our 130.

Not worth porting:
- its prepared actor lights (its most expensive kernel);
- its RAM-buffer-plus-copy packet path;
- AoS20 (already in our static path).

Worth porting (with estimated hardware savings):
1. prepared per-model records instead of the GC front end (-8 to -12).
   - **v1 landed as FRONT_NATIVE=1 (c881fba): -4.1 hw ms** (129.0 -> 124.9; band -3.7 to -4.6). ModelRender draws from only the state the bridge reads.
   - Proof: FRONT_NATIVE=2 compares every model part bit-exactly (0 mismatches over 349,713 parts); the logic trace is STRICT.
   - Ceiling: -11.8 if the whole model front end goes. Left for v2: per-TPL texture objects (~0.9), bridge build, and the HUD unitTrans O(n^2) scan (0.46).
   - Finding: effects are never drawn on DC. EspCommonTrans ends in a no-op GXCallDisplayList stub, so part of its ~1.5-2 hw ms is dead work. Most of it must be kept, because the bridge reads the m_Mat and ChannelSet colour results, so EFFECT_LEAN is estimated at only -0.4 to -0.6 hw ms (another -0.4 to -0.5 if nothing reads m_Mat).
   - Native effect sprites (the default and sub-rectangle sprite paths: fire, smoke, blood, sparks, muzzle flash, weather) are estimated at +0.3 to +0.5 hw ms in r100 (~200-230 sprites, ~20 KB TA) and +0.5 to +1.0 in an r101 fight (300-450 sprites). That's roughly cost-neutral with EFFECT_LEAN. Effect VRAM and translucent fill (large fog sheets, ~1.5 ms PVR each) are unmeasured. User decision pending. (Historical: decided 2026-09-23 and landed: EFFECT_SPRITES=1 a0a32aa, COARSE_FX_SPRITES=2, EFFECT_ROOM=7, all in build-r21.sh. Current scope keeps gore and effects; do not count these gains again.)
   - Effect creation and movement draw from the shared game random-number stream, so logic-side effect caps break the STRICT trace. Only the draw side is safe to gate.
2. one straight per-part emission loop instead of the packet/defer layer (-5 to -6);
3. precompiled HUD headers (~-1.5);
4. a small grouped render hot path (-1 to -2);
5. ~~a per-frame transformed-vertex cache for scenery~~: measured at 0. The transform-once meshlets (02d5a0f) already realise it (24.4% of corners saved), and repeats across draws use different matrices. What's left is a converter-side position/attribute split, ~-0.5 to -0.8 ms, unmeasured.

## Work plan: serialized perf lane (2026-09-23; superseded 2026-09-25 by the parallel lanes under "30 fps rethink")

Performance work was serialized until 2026-09-25: one integrated build, one change at a time.
- After each step, measure the stacked build with hwproject and Flycast, in the r100 quiet window and the r101 fight, reporting p50, p99 and max against the 50 ms target.
- Gains measured as separate arms overlap in the same frames, so only the stacked number counts.

| Step | Change | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | FRONT_NATIVE v1, RELEASE_FLAGS | landed (c881fba, ecbea1f) |
| 1 | Texture preload per room, O(1) handles, no runtime CRC (movement hitches; crowd texture cost) | finishing |
| 2 | Game-logic cuts (game30 LH recipe, then tick cuts) | LH recipe + GAME_TRIG landed (7dd50e7, 28ef388): hw game-logic 25.8 -> **12.0 ms/tick**, inside the ~15 budget; frame 157.8 -> 120.3 hw. STRICT. Next, ranked: D-cache prefetch in the logic list walks (EmAtCheck, partsWorldCalc; ceiling -3.25), EmAtCheck prefilter (<1), Hermite/vector maths (~0.5). Skip: I-cache relink (makes it worse), reciprocal fdiv (not bit-exact). Visual sims stay: cloth and pendulum write the parts chain; effects share the RNG. Per-Ganado design (design-logic/DESIGN.md, call-graph profile; hwproject's game-logic area undercounts logic because it books the shared matrix kernel as render: 29.5 vs 36.2 hw ms at 11): r100 ring fight 23.6 / 27.5 / 31.0 hw ms/tick at 4 / 6 / 8 engaged Ganados, ~1.86 per engaged Ganado (skeleton maths 0.50, foot IK 0.25, collision 0.21, key decode 0.21, EmAtCheck 0.19, AI ~0.14). Bit-exact cuts P1 partsWorldCalc reduced maths, P2 single-pass EmAtCheck, P4 motion-index binary search: 31.0 -> 28.2 at 8, STRICT; further designed cuts P3/P10/P5/P7/P6/P8/P9 project ~22.3 at 6 and ~25.2 at 8. P3 GAME_CONCAT_COL landed (dbe1abb, in LH): 25.19 -> 24.13 at 6, 28.45 -> 27.20 at 8, STRICT, fpsym2 EQUIVALENT. Rejected: P10 GAME_PWC_FAST (+0.45 hw, cache hit rate 28%, prefetch bus stalls), GAME_SCHED=game (no logic gain). Next: FTRV arm with a collision-shadow check build (user sign-off before any recipe change), then P6 fused sin/cos (exhaustive 2^32 host check: 0 mismatches). ACT_CAP never parks engaged Ganados, so it doesn't change these. |
| 3 | Enemies: Leon <=5 ms, CROWD_LOD tiers, ACT_CAP, safe cuts (FX_LEAN, static car/cops; gore kept), Leon fewer-bone rebuild, low-poly Ganado meshes | **3a landed (520e8a0), in PERF:** NATIVE_ACTOR_LOD=1 NATIVE_ACTOR_PRELIT=1 CROWD_LOD=1 (whole-part LOD, prelit static-lit parts, near/mid/far crowd tiers; heads class 2, ladder {0.5, 0.25, 0.1}; every actor still skinned each frame; SH4 skin kernels rescheduled). hw -19.9 ms/frame with 8 Ganados on screen (144.4 -> 124.5; actor path 65.6 -> 43.9) and -4.3 in quiet r100 (114.5 -> 110.2). STRICT 2494 r100 ticks, 8 live. +19,360 B from heap 4; default image unchanged. ACT_CAP code landed off (f708887): N=8 only -1.8 hw ms and our fight check stalls at 5 kills, so it waits for a full-wave r101 fight. Earlier notes: NATIVE_ACTOR_SKIN_LAZY also fixes a 128 KiB prim-buffer overflow that made Leon vanish with 6+ Ganados. Per Ganado: 7.4 hw ms full, 4.5 with tiers. Any Ganado in view also adds ~93 hw ms of texture CRC/reload, which is step 1's fix. Logic trace STRICT at 4 and 8 Ganados. |
| 4 | Render front end: EFFECT_LEAN, EMIT_DIRECT, FRONT_NATIVE v2 | queued |
| 5 | Scenery: fog distance, tree cap, house from halfway, W9 worst views and per-room fog | queued. Trials done: 25 m far plane (room's own curve) is scenery 29.9 -> 18.7 hw ms, frame 158.3 -> 140.1. 20 m fails the enemy rule (a Ganado at 20 m is 100% fogged). Rule for other rooms: min(room far, 25 m). House from halfway (~21 m) needs per-object building fog: open. LOD 5 px (-2.9 at 42.7 m) and TREE_THIN are unmeasured on top. |

Work order (user, 2026-09-24, play testing): the r100 post-house ambush (heap 4), then **frame pacing (never to
be deprioritised again: sub-30 fps is slow motion until it lands)**, then low-poly Ganado meshes, then the Leon
rebuild. Fix review the same day: r101 scope lockup (9598ce2), launcher log, pacing, QUALITY_ASSETS into the recipe,
ambush reserve, ACTOR_FOG_GATE gates, SS_UI_ORDER. Proposed after QUALITY_ASSETS: **zero in-play disc loads per
room** (357 texture loads in play after the last preload in one Standard session; GD-ROM seeks are 100-200 ms).

**Persistent goal (user, 2026-09-24): the r101 square at 15 fps real time** ("at any cost, or the player can't
play"; budget 2 x logic + render <= 67 hw ms per drawn frame, today ~136). Plan, breakdown and the ledger of
every measured arm: [D367_SQUARE_PERF_PLAN.md](D367_SQUARE_PERF_PLAN.md). Order: logic speed-ups
(GAME_VEC_INLINE, collision fast paths, FTRV bones) -> offline-converted Ganado v4 blobs + flat light ->
converted Standard room archive with per-part residency (also the r100 ambush memory fix) -> single-version
scenery with better textures, nearer fog and a backdrop -> square PVS -> queued 64 KiB reads -> selective
-O3/LTO; Fast pacing (PACE_CAP=2) is the play default meanwhile. (The 30 fps rethink below replaced this goal on
2026-09-25.)

**30 fps rethink (user, 2026-09-25): the coarse complete square first**
(`re4-research\RE4_DC_30FPS_RETHINK_2026-09-25.md`; budget G <= 24 + R <= 6 + 3.33 margin per tick).
**Baseline correction (user review):** gameplay preservation is judged against the uncapped encounter
(ACT_CAP=0). The first capped arms (ACT_CAP=6) throttled parked Ganados and understated G by 4.82 ms.
ACT_CAP scope (architect review 2026-10-03): the 2026-09-24 approval is historical and covers the r101 square only;
the r100 house cap arm (H2, `late 0x08`) is a diagnostic spike; adopting ACT_CAP in a play recipe is a separate
decision (build-r21.sh has ACT_CAP=0). Capped results are reported apart from ACT_CAP=0 preservation claims.
Status, uncapped, same stack, hw ms:
- Step 1, qualified no-draw boundary: PACE_TRANS_SKIP=4063, **G_q = 37.52** (capped 32.70).
- Step 2, the coarse square COARSE=1 v0.4: world from collision, ribbon actors, effect markers, source
  HUD.
  - It draws in **R = 5.03** per image, against 63.22 for the source renderer.
  - STRICT with every decision identical against the uncapped control (tr41 / tr42, 4185 frames, 0 drift).
- Fit / gap: complete 42.55 ms per tick, against 33.33 bare (-9.22) and 30.00 with the margin (**-12.55**).
  R fits; **G_q must fall to <= 24.97**. G alone exceeds real time (37.52 > 33.33).
- Skeleton step (user's order, item 1) done: GAME_PWC_KERNEL=3 (last-bit, decisions identical) +
  GAME_PMC_KERNEL=1 + GAME_HERMITE_FAST=1 (exact): **G_q 37.52 -> 34.40** (landed default off: ddea9bf); complete coarse tick 39.78 ms
  (25.1 fps at 83.8% speed); gap 9.43.
- One-house test (user request): BIN 38 as a 400-triangle baked shell with a 256 VQ texture costs ~0.33
  ms per image (v2; v1 0.60), 18 KB VRAM, STRICT (tr51); views and door notes in the plan doc.
- **Current order (user, 2026-09-25):** (1) land the coarse renderer with frame pacing (done: f4da5fd), (2) R headroom

  (next bullet).
- **Parallel lanes (user, 2026-09-25: "I don't want to spend more time benchmarking. I want to focus on the
  remaining optimization that can be parallelized").** One agent per non-overlapping lane (arm prefix,
  tree under /root/probe/d367-agents): cl characters (coarse-actors-4k/stack-tree: meshes fitted to the
  character code losslessly, a cheaper adapter, then integrating new cast models), vl vertex loop
  (lane-vloop/tree: ACTOR_VTX_KERNEL; rev 1b landed 42afaa1, rev 2 7726caa, rev 3 d938501, rev 4 + 5 e4fb8e8; stopped), gc collision (lane-gcol/tree: sphere walk, em-em rows; stack landed 7caa2f7, batch 7 ca229cf, area lists rev 2 ff32da9; batch 9 ~0, not landed; parked), fx effects
  (lane-gfx/tree: Esp / Efm, exact; landed 1d3dc4d), ob enemy / object bookkeeping (lane-gfx/tree; GAME_OB_SCAN landed 0862e7c, GAME_OB_MAT + GAME_OB_PATH 9f66533, GAME_OB_NEAR + GAME_OB_DECODE 97874b5; parked), sk skeleton / motion / cloth / maths (lane-gskel/tree; batch 3 GAME_VEC_NORM_INLINE + GAME_MTXINV_SCHED 4f81bbd; exact, plus the

  (lane-bugs: memory load / unload, freezes, the r100 -> r101 -> r103 playthrough; relaunched 2026-09-26). By return
  (user, 2026-09-26): gc, ob and vl park after their current batches, wd idles; sk, cl and bg carry on. Per change: one
  cost arm and one STRICT gate, no series. The main session lands every patch via warp/tree7 (knob-off
  identity, carry-over), keeps the docs current. (The coarse HUD's "88" was the light coarse floor behind the translucent gauge;
  the coarse world's ground, 6f4c91c, fixes it.) An external, user-launched
  agent builds and reduces the first level's cast models (private `cast-20260925/`; integration COARSE_GANADO_CAST 08d2216; R levers COARSE_PREGATE / CHAR_DATA_BLOCK c6edb6f),
  and a second one will rebuild the r101 world's assets (prompt `re4-assets-private/world-agent-20260926/`, 2026-09-26); no in-session agent
  builds models. Lane map and owners: the plan doc, "Current order and status".
- Characters (2026-09-25): the reduced models (3,989-triangle Leon, 874-triangle Ganado) draw through the
  actors30 character code. Version C measured (r101 square, ACT_CAP=0, frames 1000-1119; every figure
  names its image): coarse world + reduced characters W 57.13, R 26.47 (cl21; 17.5 fps every tick drawn
  at 58% speed, 3.0 fps paced to full speed); coarse stick figures W 34.71, R 4.05 (cl22; 28.8 fps at 96%,
  19.8 paced); the source renderer with the same reduced characters R 63.02 (cl26), with source
  characters R 68.92 (cl27). The reduced characters cost 22.42 ms over stick figures (re4dc_actor_submit
  12.5, adapters 5.8, skin palettes 1.3); gate cl24 STRICT. The fast character path, first results: the cl
  lane's lossless mesh fitting and FTRV adapters (landed 9df764b, default off) took the characters to 15.84 ms
  (cl42: W 50.55, R 19.89, 4.0 fps paced; STRICT); next is the vl lane's vertex loop. Further mesh gains
  need new assets (the external agent). Plan doc,
  "Reduced characters and the character path".
- WP2 Leon pair (2026-10-03, architect review follow-up; hwsim projections in Flycast, not console measurements).
  Image H2 (r100 house, Leon's radio-call close-up), ticks 1450..1569, all 120 frames traced, ACT_CAP=0, build
  impl-w2c, one binary: Leon by the native 4K cast 49.55 ms work per tick vs the old per-part source path 56.64,
  7.09 ms saved (low-high 5.48-9.25). The old path came back because after the s20 cutscene Leon's material-lifetime
  records are dropped (a part swap at about UI frame 684, a heap teardown at about 1211) and nothing re-proves them.
  The existing default-off CROWD_READOPT=2 re-proves them with the load-time proof. Adopting it in the play recipe
  is a coordinator/user decision; it also changes the r100 post-cutscene Leon from the source mesh to the 4K cast,
  as already drawn in r101/r103.
  **Adopted (user 2026-10-03):** build-r21.sh sets CROWD_READOPT=2 CROWD_CULL=1 CROWD_FOGSKIP=1. Gate (impl lane,
  builds from ed818b8e): STRICT H2 120/120 (1450..1569), 100/100 (1300..1399), whole r100 1391/1391; r101 bell
  120/120 (1000..1119), 100/100 (900..999), whole r101 941/941; route checks r100 calls (movies complete, cliff
  loan back), r101 bell, r103 entry HALT 0 MISSING 0; Leon captures normal (one two-toned hair frame at a hit, in
  r101 where the cast was already drawn: not these knobs). r101 kite STRICT skipped (D: floor). Gore stumps take
  the whole source path (crowd lane note; not exercised in the captures).
- The calibration disc c8 is in `D:\RE4DC-HWCAL` with the model's predictions (hwcal PREDICTIONS.md).
  It awaits the user's console run.
- Landed f4da5fd (default off; knob-off identity, tr42 carry-over): frame pacing (PACE_CATCHUP), PACE_TRANS_SKIP,
  the decision-trace tags and COARSE v0.4 (coarse.cpp). Still private (tree5): the skeleton-step kernels,
  COARSE_HOUSE, the model-diagnostic latch, SS_UI_ORDER, MOTION_RESERVE, the heap / pool logs,
  GAME_SKEL_AUDIT, GAME_IK_PASS.
- Landed 801d72d (default off; knob-off identity, tr55 carry-over): the R-headroom knobs GAME_OT_MASK,
  GAME_ID_LISTS, UI_HEAP_LAZY, UI_PALETTE_SLOTS and the coarse effect-loop hoist (all exact, STRICT), and
  code placement: LINK_ORDER + tools/d367/ordgen_c3.py + link-order/r101-square-c3-8k.ld (never-draw G
  -1.25, drawn -0.94; STRICT).

Details and the ledger are in [D367_SQUARE_PERF_PLAN.md](D367_SQUARE_PERF_PLAN.md).

Parallel tracks (off the frame path; needed for the console gate):
- r101/r103 bring-up (frontier W4, W9 packages) and the route bugs: the bg lane (lane-bugs; relaunched 2026-09-26);
- audio;
- cutscenes;
- inventory/retry (W11);
- GDEMU disc reads (W10).

Asset exploration (PS2/Blender) is parked after the house images.

## Frame pacing (2026-09-23, design-pacing/DESIGN.md)

The game runs one logic tick per rendered frame (main.cpp waits for GetSystemVcnt()=2 vsyncs; no catch-up, no delta time), so any frame over 33.3 ms is slow motion: 20 fps = 67% speed. Chosen: render skip / catch-up (PACE_CATCHUP), with logic at 30 Hz by the vsync clock and draws skipped when behind (at most 2 ticks per drawn frame, 15 fps floor knob). ModelRender plus its deferred draws is ~90% of non-logic work and writes nothing logic reads. Trans() can't be skipped (Filter08Trans uses the shared RNG), and ShadowTrans, Espgen45, TexRender, Filter00/03 and drawLaserSight write logic-read state. Stages: v1 (ModelRender + native frame; 24.3 hw ms/tick left, Standard quiet), v2 (+ModelTrans; 20.7), v3 (+effect/HUD callbacks; 16.5; needs trace digests). Estimates: Standard quiet 43 hw ms -> v2 100% speed at 17 fps, v3 at 19 fps (today 78% at 23 fps). Fights: logic alone is 71/82/93% of the CPU at 4/6/8 engaged Ganados, so no pacing gives full speed there: 43-51% speed at 13-15 fps with the floor, 59-71% at 9-11 fps without. The corrected Standard fight frame is ~65 hw ms (the earlier ~53 used area-method logic). v1 + v2 were built in the private tree and landed on 2026-09-25 as f4da5fd, default off (play discs pass `PACE_CATCHUP=2 PACE_MODE=fast PACE_CAP=2`; the Options row is a later item).

**Tick vs drawn image (architect review 2026-10-03).** "One logic tick per rendered frame" above describes the
original loop. Terms from now on:
- a **logic tick** is one 33.3 ms game update; a **drawn image** is one presented frame;
- with active pacing (PACE_CATCHUP=2, Fast / Smooth) ticks run without draws, so fps and game speed are separate
  numbers;
- capacity per second of game time is **30 x G + F x R <= 1000 ms** (G = work per tick, R = render work per drawn
  image, F = drawn images a second). Admission uses direct cadence measurements (new images a second, game speed),
  not the formula;
- G / R values and the quiet / coarse / fight estimates in this document belong to their own images (Standard quiet,
  the coarse square, the kite fight). They do not transfer to the house images H and H2 (checklist "Benchmark
  fixtures") or to the r21s play image; measure each image.

User decision 2026-09-24: TA_DOUBLEBUF (async TA double buffer, ~12.5 ms/frame of stream_open wait removed; hw projection ~16 -> 20 fps at the 50 ms target) is adopted and option C (single-bank PVR layout, bigger texture pool) is dropped. It lands after sub-screen option (b) (single-bank TA while a sub screen is open) and a matched-window hwproject pair.

**TA_DOUBLEBUF landed (b7a7e2d, 2026-09-24) and is in the canonical recipe (PERF).** Option (b) as designed:
`pvr_set_vbuf_doublebuf()` (KOS patch kos-804b319-vbuf-switch) drops the TA to one bank while the sub-screen
backing holds bank 1, and stream_open switches back lazily. Gates: knob-off identity; inventory open/close in r100
and in the r101 fight (backing hash ok, no HALT); logic trace STRICT over 3,604 ticks; hwproject r101 fight
145.0 vs 145.7 hw ms (CPU-equal, matched game-logic rows). **Measured gain on the canonical recipe is smaller than
the study's ~12.5 ms:** Flycast PC-sampler wall in r100 quiet 73.2 -> 71.3 ms mean (p99 79 -> 74; the single-bank
fence waited 1.7 ms/frame), and 106.2 -> 106.2 ms in the r101 fight (the fence waited 0.08 ms/frame, since the frame
is CPU-bound). The study used a lighter SUBSCREEN=0 fixture (53.9 ms busy). The wait is at most one render per
frame and appears only when the CPU part of a frame is close to the render time, which is where the lane is
heading (50 ms target). Re-measure it on hardware with the calibration disc.

**Room discovery round 2 (2026-09-24, 9f2f45a..49b97b2; user: "we need that to make it through the game scalable").**
`assets.sh discover` now lints each needed module for the known porting traps and writes the module wiring
(`--wire`; audit list only when the lint is clean), lists heap-4 options per enemy archive with a covering plan,
checks each event's evd (route movie, or prepared + qualified evd), and reports Standard budgets and VRAM. Game logic
is never generated. For the r100 after-state crows (171,328 B short in Original): Standard with QUALITY_ASSETS=1 fits
(packages -282,560 B, 111,232 spare); for Original the cheapest option is a new em21 motion-stream contract
(<= 294,240 B). r101's enemy heap-4 room is measured (3,048,704 B, fits 1,595,136 spare); r103's waits for W8b.

User decisions 2026-09-26 (evening): (1) "We can't compromise on the environments so we really need to deal with it":
the r101 environment's look is the goal (as original as possible, not a "VR arena"), and the budget is made to fit it
(renderer vertex paths, characters, the fight's gameplay, VRAM / heap reclaims), not the other way round; the external
world agent prices what the look needs ("needs room") instead of cutting to the caps. (2) "We should work backwards from
the original world": start from the GameCube render set as is (all parts, source textures, source light), price it, and
reduce step by step (invisible reductions first, then near-identical, then visible). (3) The user doubts the original
world was ever fully drawn on the port: the port's "source renderer" captures used the Standard LOD package, so the
reference is an offline render of the GameCube render set; an audit and measurement are running
(/root/probe/d367-agents/original-world-20260926/). Measured the same day (version C, landed stack): G_std 24.84,
G_fight 29.30, R_fight 11.77 (~10 fps paced in the 6-Ganado kite fight), so 30 fps in the heavy fight is out of reach
with this image; the heavy-fight choices come with the make-room plan.

User decisions 2026-09-26 (night), on the world agent's C1b review (its sheets set against real GameCube frames from
Dolphin): **"Go with recommendations"**:
- **Look A:** source tiles + source light, unit normals.
- **Ground R14:** the source soft ground / shadow layers drawn as PVR translucent layers from the resident I4 masks, with a
  constant black colour. Estimated at +6,144 B VRAM and ~+0.6-0.75 ms SH-4 in the named views. G42 stays only as the
  fallback if the hardware fill page rejects the TR fill.
- **Trees:** the PS2 geometry direction, keeping the BIN17 forests as geometry. Estimated V3 tree share 6.44 ms, against
  13.52 for the GC trees.
- **Fog F0:** the approved 25 m.

The first slice (d1) is authorized (re4-assets-private world-agent-20260926 reviews\c1.md). Before its in-game sheet,
the runtime needs:
- R14 (a reserved mode today);
- a memory fit for the whole square (the PS2 trees alone are ~1.19 MB of layout-11 arrays);
- the native PS2 tree materials;
- the ground-brightness fix.

**Tried for real the same evening:** the port draws the full original set in-game.
- The set loads and draws at the square and matches the GameCube in shape and texture. The exceptions are the parts
  whose pair package is missing (invisible) and ~2 wrap-rejected packets a frame in F and W1.
- Cost (image C: 70 m, LOD 0; ot4 / ot5, F): R 94.74 hw ms, ~8 fps. The game's own GX path: R 689.
- The look gaps against Dolphin:
  - the ground is 1.3-3.2x too dark on every port path (cause under diagnosis);
  - no Filter00;
  - the sky and treeline are lost in the 25 m fog;
  - the V1E bonfire is missing;
  - 12 pair packages are not built by the pipeline;
  - no dither and no mips.
- Report: /root/probe/d367-agents/original-tryit-20260926/compare/REPORT.md. The look-gaps job
  (/root/probe/d367-agents/look-gaps-20260926/) is diagnosing the ground, the fires and a PVR Filter00.

Progress 2026-09-28. **Landed r19 -> r21** (user: "Yes land"): the Codex continuation's playability tree r19
(4fb68a8: actor transaction/owner path, the PS2 r101 world drawer PS2_WORLD_DRAW, manual pages, pad prompts, VMU
dialog), r20 (8745fac: PS2_WORLD_KERNEL, UI_HUD_MASK), r21 (09e6175: the PS2 world converted to R4IM v3 and drawn by
MeshDraw, PS2_WORLD_MESH; 64-vertex meshlets and UI_HUD_LENS_ALPHA=230 user-adopted; MEMPROF) and coarse_finite
(36e28e0). All knobs default off; the r21 recipe is tools/d367/build-r21.sh. (2026-10-03, 8f34aa63: it now writes
`$OUT/resolved-knobs.txt` with make's own resolved values, whose path route-build.sh records in programs-route.json;
MODEL_DRAW_PLANS is forced to 1 by the D349_RENDERER_STACK=1 override in the Makefile, whatever the line says.) A clean build of 36e28e0 passes STRICT vs
r20k3w over ticks 0..1941 (kite-r21land). Private source data stays outside git: ganado_source_extras.h and
vmu_dialog_english.inc come from the private asset dir (VMU_DIALOG_TEXT_DIR, default COARSE_ACTOR_ASSET_DIR). The shared
checkout's dirty overlay: 57 of its 71 modified files now equal dreamcast-port; 14 still differ.
**Release split (kite fight, frames 600..720, hw ms/frame):** traced builds carry ~30 ms of trace/diagnostics (r21
traced 128.4, release 98.7). Never-draw twin (PACE_FORCE=A needs PACE_MODE=smooth; PACE_MODE=off disables it) 45.9
with 16.9 of vsync wait: **G ~29.0**; **R ~69.7** = world 21.9, characters ~35 (actor path 18.4 + skin/palettes ~16.6),
UI 4.1, copies 3.6, KOS idle 2.2, isfinite ~2.6 (+ call overhead), TA submit 0.5. coarse_finite: 98.7 -> **93.3**.
The memory-copy item below is ~4 ms in release (the 15-19 ms figures were traced builds). World: 23.8k vertices and
~5,200 strips a frame; PS2 strips average 4.4 corners because UV seams stop joins (position-only keys: 6.7), so
per-strip overhead is about half the world's cost. Order by expected gain: characters (cl), world strips/emit, G 29 -> 24.
**Same day, later.** ACTOR_CENSUS (diagnostic) shows the per-part native path carries room props at source detail,
not only characters: the burning officer on the stake (r101 obj00, placed for region != 0; ~3.9k vertices/frame,
~4.1 hw ms by an A/B skip), doors, item pickups, racks, boxes, windows, the handgun: ~8.6k vertices, ~8 hw ms. The
reduced Leon/Ganados are drawn (ATX: ~3 reduced Ganados a frame; a few fall back). Props and world share the real
limit: ~200 cycles per drawn vertex (world 21.9 ms / 23.8k vertices). PS2 world strips cannot be joined invisibly:
39% of triangles are single quads with their own UV/colour (a swap stripifier, mesh_lod STRIP_SWAPS /
ps2_world_r4im --strip-swaps, gains only -13% strips, -0.4% corners; kept off). MESH_PRIME_LAZY (exact: prime only the
cache entries meshlets use; ~30k entries/frame were stamped for ~24k vertices): 93.3 -> **91.5** hw ms, STRICT
kite-r21lzt; on in tools/d367/build-r21.sh. Next: a software-pipelined meshlet transform (one vertex at a time now,
~64 cycles/vertex with fsrra), the near-plane clipper (~20% of MeshDraw::draw for ~170 strips/frame).
MESH_CLIP_LEAN (exact in pixels): 94% of the strips reaching the near/far clipper were wholly outside one
frustum plane (ground under the camera); they are dropped by a homogeneous test, and each clipped corner is computed
once: 91.5 -> **88.4** hw ms, accepted strips identical, STRICT kite-r21clt. Recipe truth (architect review
2026-10-03, 8f34aa63): MESH_CLIP_LEAN is **not** in the play recipe (build-r21.sh's make line never had it; game30.mk
default 0; the recipe header that claimed it is corrected). **Adopted 2026-10-03 (user):** build-r21.sh sets it. Gate (impl lane,
WP1d tree): H2 58.71 -> 56.53 hw ms (-2.18, all scenery 9.10 -> 6.44), STRICT 120/120, 100/100, r100 1391/1391; off/on
captures in the house and the r101 square fight (near fences and posts, wide views to the frustum edges, blood spray)
draw the same complete scenery. Not proven: pixel-exact frames, r103 views, console TA time. World distance detail is on (MESH_LOD;
Standard uses QUALITY_LOD_PX = 5 px, MESH_LOD_PX only applies to Original): 10 px 86.4, 1000 px (coarsest level
everywhere) 84.4, so world LOD is worth at most ~4 ms in the kite square (near geometry dominates).
Trap: never seed an objdir from another tree's objdir (its .d files name the old targets; edited includes keep stale
objects: the first coarse_finite arm ran with a stale coarse_ganado.o).
**Warp tour (user: "use the warp tool in more places such as r100 and r101")**: fixtures under the private
playability-r11-r1/tour/ (a shared turn/walk/run pad script; per-preset scripts close r101's post-bell call with A and
the r101 entry "Playing Manual 2" with A x4 + B x3; the post-bell preset backs off the r103 door first). It found:
(1) r100 after the ambush (r100-s20) HALTed at room frame ~600, "motion key allocation" (heap 4 full/fragmented while
the key cache was under budget): **MOTION_OOM_EVICT** (41d0310) evicts LRU unpinned keys and retries; one event, runs
to the end, STRICT, knob-off identical. The heap-4 shortage itself remains. (2) **r100 had no world in the r21 build**:
coarse images skipped all source scenery and drew the grey collision view outside r101 (the only PS2 world package).
**COARSE_SCENERY_FALLBACK** (0b68ee3) skips scenery only where re4dc_ps2_world_covers(room); other rooms draw their
assetpipe Standard R4IM scenery, and the owned-actor TR barrier closes the tree-impostor PT window first (else "native
closed pass requested"). STRICT, knob-off identical; r100 gate / east door / s20 draw textured and lit. The r100-bridge
preset opens a cutscene (needs a longer lead-in). A per-room PS2 world package stays an optional upgrade (the r101
chain in world-mesh-r21 is r101-hard-wired; r100/r103 PS2 exports exist under d353-ps2-r100-prelit and d367-agents/w9).
Tour hw ms (release sfr = 0b68ee3 recipe + PC sampler; frames 400..880 of the tour walk; "work" = frame minus the
vsync spin in main, which is ~0 in the CPU-bound kite fight): r101 entry 44.3 (work 36.2), r101 post-bell door 38.2
(35.6), r100 gate after the radio 47.2 (40.4), r100 east door 45.6 (33.7), r100 s20 house after the ambush 76.7 (51.4);
kite fight 88.4 (no spin). Render side dominates everywhere (game-render-side 19-42 + actors 5-15 hw ms); game logic
0.8-7 hw ms outside the fight. So ordinary play is ~20 fps (work just over 33.3 ms), the heaviest views 15 fps or lower.
r103 entry: the r21 base disc still carries the uncompacted st1/r103.dar (4,814,112 B), so em12.drs (1.08 MB) failed
with 402 KB free and model.cpp(1907) HALTed. Staging W8b's compact room (design-r103/w8b-r103-data-recipe.sh ->
w8b-rel/st1/r103.{dar,arc}, 1,455,456 B loaded; regenerated 2026-09-28, the old output was gone) plus m-r103-FIN fixes
it: r103 draws (trees, fence, house, animals, Ganados) and runs. hw 55.7 ms/frame (work 51.6; game logic 10.6 with 5
Ganados + animals). Every disc that reaches r103 needs these ROOMFILES.
**Exact character-path kernels (2026-09-28/29; hw ms as frame / work, work = frame minus the modelled vsync
spin, which is the hardware-relevant figure outside the CPU-bound kite).** AVK_RIGID6 (a5b11de): rigid parts with
stride-6 positions / stride-3 normals get generated pipelined kernels instead of the C fallback (exact, STRICT
kite-r21r7t): r101 entry 44.3 -> 42.2, post-bell 38.2 -> 37.2, r100 / kite neutral. GAME_WPAL_FAST=3 + GAME_SK1_ASM
(3f20eda): MakeWeightPalette and the source skinning CalcSk1_x/_x2 (morphed infos skinned in Trans(), in place, and
the Render() materialisation; SKIN_CENSUS: 2 morphed infos / 3,278 vertices a frame at r101 post-bell, 0 defer
failures) as exact SH-4 loops (check builds 0 mismatches over 70.1M / 29.8M words): r101 entry 42.2/35.9 -> 42.0/34.3,
post-bell 37.2/34.4 -> 36.8/32.5, r100 east door 45.8/33.8 -> 45.7/32.8, kite 89.1 -> 86.8. Post-bell and the east door
now average under 33.3 ms of work. Traps: -m4-single -ml passes float args pair-swapped (the first float in fr5);
serial log lines (aica notes, "[stage") can cut into a trace line, so a timing change can make the STRICT audit
REJECT on one garbled record: compare the records of two runs (every record in the window matching in at least one).
Fixed (2026-09-29): LOGIC_TRACE=1 builds append each re4dc_log line with interrupts off (RE4DC_LOG_ATOMIC on
platform/mem.o; the aica sequencer thread preempted the byte loop), and read_log.py prints whole lines only (its
"[stage N]" marker landed after a line the guest was still appending). Release builds are byte-identical.
Next candidates by size: the skinned-vertex kernels themselves (avk_pos_skin + avk_light_skin 4.5-6 ms at r101),
Part::whole (TA emit, 1.1-1.8), per-meshlet overhead in pass_positions (0.7-1.3), actor_submit preflight (~0.2).
**Correction (2026-09-29): the tour window 400..880 is not all gameplay.** At r101 entry it overlaps the
"Playing Manual" pages (IDSystem::unitTrans 1.56 ms, the sub screen's 434-unit ID pool; the lists fall back there on
be_flag 0xEF), and the other presets' windows start near their scripted prompts. Measured again at frames 900..1380
(release, everything landed through ACTOR_STATS_LEAN d21356f0; work = frame minus the modelled vsync spin):
r101 post-bell 37.2 / **35.8**, r100 east door 40.0 / **34.6**, r100 after the radio 50.5 / **49.9**, and **r101 entry in
play (Ganados approaching the square) 67.7 / 67.7** (render side 28.0, actors 12.7, game logic 9.3, world 9.1, UI 3.8,
copies 2.7). So quiet views are ~2 ms over 33.3 and the square with Ganados is ~2x, close to the kite fight (86.2).
The exact kernels above are real but small against that; the square needs the render budget work (characters,
world) and G. Use 900..1380 (or later) for tour benchmarks; ACTOR_STATS_LEAN (d21356f0, exact, STRICT
kite-r21slt1): actor_submit 2.26 -> 2.20 (post-bell), 1.38 -> 1.21 (kite).

Progress 2026-09-26 (night). **Corrections:** the evening figures were sampled on one `Frame_cnt` residue (trace
stride 8); over all ticks G_std is ~25.92 and G_fight ~29.61, so **G is not closed**, and every R / world cost arm ran at
FOG_FAR 18000 instead of the approved 25 m (square plan, "Corrections"; the stride 7 + 25 m re-baseline is running).
**The original world** (/root/probe/d367-agents/original-world-20260926/, try-it run original-tryit-20260926/): the full
GameCube render set of r101 (209 placements, 81 BINs, 135,813 triangles, 112 images, GC trees, per-frame light, 70 m
far) was never drawn by the game at the square: the P1 viewer was not the game, the P2 GX path ran out of heap 4, and
the "Original" quality package is itself reduced (PS2 trees, baked light, LOD biases, 25 m) and draws 10 of its 20
colour + mask pair packages invisible. Every "source renderer" image since 2026-09-25 is Standard quality. The data is
complete (offline reference renders); the GX path now runs in the game at the square (heap 4 minimum 679 KB free,
villagers, no HALT); Original mode halts after the bell on a KOS sbrk out-of-memory (sub screen). Light: the port's
unit-normal light matches a real-game Dolphin frame within 1-4% once the per-frame Filter00 (glow + contrast) is
added, so Filter00 is the visible gap, not the light maths. The sky dome and treeline sit 57-63 m from the square and
vanish only through the 25 m fog. Cost ladder (LADDER.md; estimates; the reduced Original mode's scenery measured
25.33 ms in F at 18 m): the original as is (70 m far) ~54.7 ms of world in F (57.9 V1E, 79.2 V3, 94.2 W1); invisible reductions (I11) 5.6 F / 8.4
V1E / 14.9 V3 / 4.6 W1; with a W1-class kernel ~2.1 F / 3.3 V1E / 6.3 V3 (2.9 with PS2 trees) / 1.9 W1. In V3 the GC
trees are 47.8 of 57 ms, so trees need a visible choice; hidden-placement culling (PVS, ~17 ms in F) is not built yet.
**World runtime rev 2 landed** default off (e69737e: COARSE_WORLD bits 16-128, the external world agent's renderer
contract rev 2; COARSE_NO_STD_SCENERY reclaims 599,424 B of heap 4 in coarse rooms, not for play recipes until door
and death captures show packaged scenery where the coarse path does not draw). **Route fixes** (7f1533d..c999bea):
(a) the SE random tables reached the Dreamcast big-endian on every disc (wild reads and stores, "Illegal SE No.",
extra draws of the shared game RNG); le_mirror now converts them (`--snd-random` for mirrors and derived archives);
switching the disc mirrors needs new logic-trace references and regenerated derived archives, scheduled while no lane
measures against the old references; the d367 / d362 / mirror-ss mirrors' bgm/doorse.dat and bgm/bio4midi.dat also kept GameCube headers in every
container but the first; the -rndle3 mirrors fix both (equal to mirror-w4q's). The switch (rev 4 in preparation, with
a guard that refuses a trace pair across it) moves every builder at once. (b) The r100 post-house call no longer soft-locks when the s20 ambush fills heap 4
(5fd2fe9: the call runs without the radio model), and cManager createBack takes a backed free slot when the source's
slot cannot be backed (5c33747). (c) The s20 route movie claims VRAM with a fallback pass when the pool has no hole
(072b574; user play 09-24: 6 of 10 s20 arrivals played the movie) and a failed open discards the interrupted frame's
scene (5d811f3; 0 fence stalls in 32 runs). (d) Warp rig: `kill` / `goto` verbs, r100-s20 presets, STALL_DIAG (1b2bcc3). (e) **r100 heap 4 for s20 and the full
ambush** (66b8edd): `room_smd.py release` strips the BINs the r100 Original + Standard packages already cover from the
block files (A1, +1,086,464 B) and the room archive (A2, +696,640 B more); at arena fit 13,312,000 the control fails
the s20 movie (0/571) while A1 plays it 571/571, spawns the full GameCube ambush and reaches the post-house call. The
data is private (lane-bugs/h4-data) and goes onto user discs only after the audit's missing proofs: an ambush STRICT
pair against a streamed-ambush control, tick-matched pixels in Standard and Original, a cost arm, and for A2 an
equalised s20 pair (the smaller archive moves the wall-timed s40 movie end). Smaller block files shorten the game's
block-swap stops (15/29/15 -> 9/17/9 ticks): that is load timing under the door rule, and running-tick logic must stay
STRICT with the stop ticks removed.

User decisions 2026-09-24 (later): (1) **r103: go.** Implement design-r103 PLAN (W8b room-archive compaction, W8c
textures + the post-bell radio stream, W8d census, W8e bell -> door -> r103; the r103 -> r106 exit fades to the title
on test discs). This is the end of the opening route. (2) **r100 Standard look approved and TREE_IMPOSTOR's 77 KB
(PT list) approved:** Standard stays the default and QUALITY_ASSETS=1 joins the M1 recipe after its gates (r100
Standard run, STRICT Standard vs Original, hw ms). With the Standard packages the r100 after-state crows fit (111 KB
spare). (3) **ACTOR_FOG_GATE's 1-pixel difference: delegated** ("make whatever looks good and is not too
computationally intensive"): prefer zero visible difference (cull only beyond far + a margin) unless the margin
costs more than ~0.2 hw ms against the 1-pixel variant; decided by the hwproject pair.

Progress 2026-09-24 (W8e, route A end): **r101 -> r103 through the real door works** (warp-r101-pbdoor4): the
post-bell radio call (stream 1:0x33, 5.2 s in full) closes on A, the door sound plays, DOORDEMO ends, r103 loads with
0 HALT/MISSING, em12 linked fresh (em15 -> em12), heap 4 free 1,127,104, VRAM 695 KB free, 0 missing textures. Two
port bugs every non-palindromic door hit: (a) 17f2aa5 `next_room` byte order (GlobalWork overlays u16 next_room on
next_stage/next_room_no; little-endian read 1:03 as 0x301 and HALTed); (b) fee2492 le_mirror converted only the first
container of bgm/doorse.dat (door sounds 1-11 kept GC headers; the door-sound read never completed) and of
bgm/bio4midi.dat (music archives 1-16: same latent fault for later BGM). Test rig: 1c9ae7d warp `dead` +
preset r101-post-bell-door (the bell's 40 dead ESL entries). Tooling: ac59b0f `discover --fix` (value-init,
slot-math; 124 of 130 sites across all modules fixed mechanically, all of stage 1). Next: W8f natural route (r101-bell
trg -> door), W8g perf bench in r103.

ACTOR_FOG_GATE's 1 pixel resolved without a trade: the framebuffer is RGB565 and the two values (blue 115 vs 123) are
one 5-bit step: a fully fogged polygon dithered against the undithered background, not a visible object. A far+margin
cull leaves the same residue wherever it culls, so the margin buys nothing: the gate stays at margin 0 (the cheaper
variant) and satisfies "no visible difference". Remaining gates before PERF: full STRICT tg0/tg1, n8 shots, hw quiet/n8.

User decisions 2026-09-23: (1) the fight floor (smoother-slower vs choppier-faster) is deferred until real numbers exist; it stays the PACE_FLOOR_FPS knob, default 15. (2) One early console timing run of a self-running r100 fight calibration disc is approved, purely to calibrate the hardware model (results on screen and on the VMU). All other console tests still wait for r100 -> r101 -> r103. (3) Gameplay-equivalent maths in game logic (SH-4 FTRV/FIPR for skeleton and foot IK) is approved as a measured option under the existing last-bit FP policy: deterministic but not bit-identical, with collision checked separately before adoption.

## 20 fps hardware budget (2026-09-23)

Game logic is a fixed 30 Hz tick: one update per frame (main.cpp, 2 vsyncs), with no delta-time scaling; only pad repeat timers use GetSystemVcnt. Rendering at 20 fps at the correct game speed therefore needs 1.5 logic ticks per rendered frame, so logic is a fixed per-second tax whatever the frame rate. At the modelled 25.8 ms/tick, logic alone is 77% of the CPU.

| Area | HW now (LD) | 20 fps budget (50 ms) |
|---|---|---|
| Game logic | 25.8 / tick (38.7 / frame) | ~15 / tick (22.5 / frame) |
| GC render front-end | 37.3 | ~3 (replace it; don't trim it) |
| Actors | 34.5 | ~7 (Leon full, Ganado tier + crowd rules) |
| Scenery | 31.4 | ~8 (shorter fog, coarser LOD, impostors, house shells) |
| UI / texture cache | 12.3 | ~2 (O(1) handles) |
| Copies + TA + KOS | 16.6 | ~7.5 |

User decisions (2026-09-23):
- **Approved:** shorter fog/draw distance, ~43 m -> 20-30 m ("most of the game is outdoors"). It must never hide an enemy within engagement range; trials pick the distance.
- **Approved, "more drastic":** Ganado crowd rules. Near 2-3 full detail; mid tier about 1/4 vertices, rigid parts, skinned every other frame; far tier a few hundred triangles, skinned every 3rd-4th frame. Leon always full; threats are never culled.
- **Closed, not possible:** visual-only simulations at half rate. Cloth and pendulum write the model parts chain, which feeds hit and attach points, and effects draw from the shared game random-number stream, so both change game state.
- **Decided (2026-09-23):**
  - Fog: 25 m confirmed ("34% fogged at 20 m seems right"). For reference, PS2 draws r100 to 78.9 m (EXP fog, end 263 m, ratio 0.70) and r101 to 38.4 m in most cuts; GC draws 42.7 m and 70 m.
  - House appearance: ~40% of the approach under the 25 m wall is fine; no per-object building fog.
  - Simplified house shells (item 21, MESH_TEXTURES=1): the mid mesh with a 512 VQ texture (66 KB per house), used everywhere with no near swap. -0.71 hw ms for FILE_01/17+18; ~-1.6 to -1.8 projected for all FILE_01. Step 5.
  - Effects: bring back native sprites for muzzle flash, blood and fire (+0.5 to 1.0 hw ms), together with EFFECT_LEAN. Step 4.
  - Cutscene subtitles: no, for now.
  - **Historical (architect review 2026-10-03):** the Low / Original mode items below are not current scope. Current
    scope: gore and effects kept, Standard quality only, `QUALITY_PICKER=0` (no boot picker; play recipe in the
    checklist). Gains that have since landed (kernels, batching, preloading, effect sprites) are not future
    options; do not count them again.
  - **Low setting mode (requested 2026-09-23):** a pre-game debug-menu toggle (Normal / Low, plus per-feature switches) that turns on the aggressive options: full replacement of the GC model drawing path, the Leon rebuild plus low-poly Ganados, and occlusion.
    - Normal targets 20 fps; Low pushes toward 30 fps (33 ms hw).
    - The switches are runtime, not compile-time. Only the selected asset set is resident. The logic trace is STRICT across modes.
    - In design at /root/probe/d367-agents/design-lowmode, design-scenery and design-ganado.
  - Outlook: all planned work lands at ~50-65 hw ms in quiet views, so 20 fps is the target. 30 fps would need every area near its floor at once.
  - **Low mode decisions (2026-09-23, design at /root/probe/d367-agents/design-lowmode):**
    - Estimates: Low is worth -2 to -4.5 hw ms quiet and -7 to -13.5 in r101 fights. It's a safety margin, not 30 fps.
    - The full native model path (-9 to -13 hw ms, bit-exact, records held in the existing 64 KiB slab) is ON in Standard.
    - Heavier Low levers approved: flat Ganado lighting; a draw-side crowd rule; a scenery-only cull at 18-20 m, with the fog kept at 25 m, only if it doesn't visibly pop.
    - Decided 2026-09-23: crowd rule **N=2** (the nearest 2 Ganados at near/mid detail, the rest at the far tier, none hidden; 8-Ganado fight 31.5 vs 32.1 hw ms at N=6, design-ganado 08). **FTRV render maths: yes** (render-only transforms; the logic trace stays STRICT). **Flat Ganado lighting: yes**, default in Standard (~-5.8 hw ms in the 8-Ganado fight, model estimate; verify on the hw model). **Heads always detailed: no** (heads follow the body's L1/L2 level).
    - A Low effect draw cap (draw side only): yes.
    - Thermal scope, self shadow and cast shadow stay in the build.
    - The quality choice is remembered on the VMU.
    - Picker: once per boot, at the first title main menu, in the game's message window; per-feature submenu in test builds only.
      - Built (`QUALITY=1`, default off; `port/dreamcast/game/quality_picker.cpp`, `platform/quality.{h,cpp}`): after Start, "Graphics quality" / "Standard" (budget-first, the default) / "Original" (faithful); up/down + A (attr 0x00800000, vertical choices). `/cd/dc/quality.txt`: `mode=standard|original`. Fixture proof w10q9-picker: no record -> Standard highlighted first; Down -> Original, A picks, record stored, frozen at titleExit.
      - The choice is the 32-byte `R4CF` record (`Re4dcQualityCfg`) through `re4dc_quality_cfg_load/store`: weak in-memory versions until the VMU layer (design-vmu S5) links the RE4DCCFG file.
      - Not visible yet: GX is a stub on the DC, so no `cMes` text renders anywhere (the picker, prompts, card Yes/No). The native message renderer (the game's own font) is W11's, after its MES/getMes fix.
    - Leon's face bones: PS2 FMV replaces most story cutscenes, so merge them always in Low, unless a route event still in-engine shows Leon's face up close (being checked).
    - Occlusion at the 25 m fog is ~0.1 hw ms for 32.7 KB heap: dropped unless the final scenery design shows more.
  - A bottom-up estimate puts Standard at ~73 hw ms quiet / ~80 in the r101 fight, above the earlier 50-65 outlook. Stacked step 3-5 measurements will settle it.
  - **Gore stays** ("keep gore don't remove it"): CUT_GORE (r103 corpses and the r100 gore object via the JP path) is rejected and must not enter the recipe. That route now relies on the r103 corpse constructor alias (55c0a5b). Safe cuts are down to FX_LEAN (foot shadows, about 0.1 ms). Particle/decal caps aren't possible (shared RNG), and screen filters stay (about 0 ms; some set game flags).
  - Added to the lane: outdoor occlusion/PVS (hide houses and trees behind buildings; est. -3 to -6 hw ms in r101/r103), step 5. Leon render rebuild with fewer skinned bones (render skin weights only; the game skeleton, attach points and hit zones untouched; ~5-6 -> ~3 hw ms), step 3. Lower-poly Ganado render meshes (heads kept), step 3.
  - **Rejected:** reduced animation/skin update rates for any actor ("might throw off gameplay"). Crowd tiers vary geometry and shading only; every actor's pose updates every frame. This supersedes the earlier "skinned every other/3rd-4th frame" crowd tiers.
- **Enemy/object census (aligned):**
  - Take the SAFE cuts: r103 corpses and the r100 gore object off via the JP path (CUT_GORE); effect and decal caps; no foot shadows; car and police props static.
  - Cap concurrent active Ganados in r101 (ACT_CAP, N=4/6/8 trials, ~12 hw ms estimate). Parked Ganados stay alive for every counter; engaged or visible threats are never parked. (Historical r101 item; capped arms throttle parked Ganados, see "Baseline correction" under the 30 fps rethink.)
  - Never cut: the r100 s03 Ganado; ESL entries 3/4/5 and 0x25; any r101 initial Ganado; the r101 kill/timer/wave logic; linked breakables.
  - Don't remove wave members: phantom kills (5 per wave) would shorten the fight.
  - Found alongside: with 10 Ganados on screen, texture_package.cpp costs 71.5 ms/frame in Flycast. It goes to the texture-hitch fix (preload per room, O(1) handles).

## Asset decisions

- **Trees:** PS2 trees for r100, with the source key texture replaced by the
  PS2 bark (VQ).
  - The worst village view drops from 61.7k to 35.7k strip corners.
  - A "groves" variant (one PS2 tree per GC trunk) costs about 2.5 ms more
    scenery time on hardware. It was compared in game (LD vs LE) and rejected:
    the visual gain is negligible.
- **PS2 static scenery** is the same geometry as GC, so there is no gain there.
- **PS2 character meshes** are not lighter (em12: 411 KB vs 407 KB). Actors
  instead rely on:
  - LOD;
  - moving non-animated room objects to the static prelit path;
  - 16-bit UV.
- **Blender** (5.2, Windows, headless) is used for measurement, planar
  decimation of static BINs and comparison renders. Its collapse and far-LOD
  output lost to the converter's own QEM LOD.

## Performance plan status (updated 2026-09-23)

Flycast ms are for r100, frames 2401-2520. The "work" figure excludes vblank
idle. Hardware figures are estimates until the projection model and the
console calibrate them.

| # | Item | Flycast effect | Hardware effect (est.) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Instanced per-BIN scenery, source-to-native static path | 1390 -> 559 | large | Done (5dd04d3, ed9393c) |
| 2 | Remove per-vertex libcalls | 559 -> 434 | similar | Done (e62cc4b) |
| 3 | NO_EH; also frees 360 KB for heap 4 | 434 -> 409 | small | Done (f10ed71) |
| 4 | Meshlet fast path + dense actor path | 409 -> 234 | large | Done (02d5a0f, bfa1452) |
| 5 | Spatial meshlet packages | 234 -> 217 | medium | Done (e62cc4b option) |
| 6 | PVR pipeline, fast wake, lean bridge | 217 -> 200 | overlaps render on hardware | Done (a1db43d) |
| 7 | Scenery LOD + source fog + far cull | 200 -> 150 | scenery ~9-11 ms | Done (64b25dd) |
| 8 | Fast actor path + deferred skinning | 150 -> 117 (actors 51 -> 18) | actors ~16 ms | Done (4fa839d) |
| 9 | PS2 trees | -2.5 ms work, heap +370 KB | worst views 61.7k -> 35.7k corners | Done; tooling committed (7a7036a) |
| 10 | Async present (PVR_PIPELINE=2, private KOS) | removes part of ~19 ms pacing waste | overlaps CPU and render | Done: LF, adopted as default (neutral in Flycast) |
| 11 | Actors pass 2: static room objects, whole-part LOD, 16-bit UV | ~18 -> ~8 | ~16 -> 3-5 | In progress |
| 12 | Game CPU: SH-4 matrix kernels, rotation cache, -O2 on hot objects | game-side 13.9 -> 9.7 (wall 116.8 -> 100.1) | logic 25.8/tick on hardware (model); target ~15 | Done (6e79b70), STRICT. Next: bit-exact faster math, visual-only sims off the tick |
| 13 | FP 6B (contract-off + FDLIBM; render-only objects exempt) | ~0 | ~0 | Done (6e79b70), user-approved float-only drift; new STRICT baseline |
| 14 | Memory-copy audit (~15 ms) | -7.5 (COPY_LEAN) | more (cache thrash) | Done (de03f28); validating on LF |
| 15 | GC render front-end removal (objTrans, light setup, normal matrices, draw-plan walk) + direct TA meshes | -6.4 (FRONT_LEAN) -3.6 (MESH_DIRECT) | similar | Done (de03f28); validating on LF |
| 16 | UI VRAM diet -> 2 MiB vertex bank | 0 | required: r100 needs ~1,031 KB of TA params per frame, overflowing 1024 KB | Done (700e2d0, UI_VRAM=1 + TA_VERTBUF_KB=2048 + tex-vq3) |
| 17 | Hardware projection model (pairing + I/D-cache simulation) | - | LD = ~158 ms on hardware (1.65x Flycast) | Done; see Hardware projection |
| 18 | fsrra, movca.l staging, SQ-direct writes, instruction scheduling (OC-RAM and pref dropped by the model) | ~0 in Flycast | fsrra -1.4, SQ/movca.l -7 to -8, scheduling up to -29 ceiling | Assigned (frontend30 pass 2, actors) |
| 19 | I-cache hot/cold code layout | ~0 in Flycast | model: +1.2 ms worse; ideal packing only -1.8 | Dropped (the per-frame code footprint of 216 KB is the problem, not layout) |
| 20 | Tree impostors beyond ~12-15 m (16 views x 128, 4bpp VQ, 82 KB VRAM) | - | -1.0 to -1.2 (heavy mean 8.62 -> 7.39-7.64 ms with PS2 trees) | Designed; needs a batched punch-through quad path. Flat at 8 m |
| 21 | Lighter near-camera FILE_01 houses (5.18 of 8.6 ms hardware scenery; 17.1k corners in 3.9k strips) | - | automatic Blender reduction only -0.17 at acceptable error; new low-poly shells with a baked texture could save most of ~4 ms | Open: needs package-supplied textures + new house meshes |
| 22 | Bytes-based TA guard + 32-byte limits (Sega rules) | 0 | correctness | After #16 |
| - | Costs being added: music + SFX, FMV decode (cutscenes only) | +1-3 ms in gameplay | +1-3 ms | Audio and cutscene agents |

**Projection.** Items 10-15 take Flycast work from ~96 ms to about 55-65 ms
(15-18 fps), which clears the ~15 fps console gate. Items 17-21 target the
rest of the way to 33 ms on hardware.

## Plan to 30 fps

Historical (2026-09-23; architect review 2026-10-03): steps 2-5 below have largely landed (FP 6B + GAME_O2,
FRONT_NATIVE / FRONT_LEAN, COPY_LEAN, PVR_PIPELINE=2 + PACE_CATCHUP, UI_VRAM + 2 MiB banks) and are in
build-r21.sh; do not count them as future gains. The current plan is "30 fps rethink" above and D367_SQUARE_PERF_PLAN.md.

Steps are ordered by expected frame-time gain.

1. Actors, second pass: static-path room objects, whole-part LOD, 16-bit UV.
   Target about 8k triangles, about 3-5 ms on hardware.
2. Game-side CPU:
   - proven-identical SH-4 matrix kernels, PS alias links and the room index
     (about -6 ms);
   - 6B then O2;
   - removing GC render front-end work the native renderer makes redundant
     (objTrans about 13 ms, GX stubs, light setup).
3. Memory-copy audit (about 15 ms).
4. Async present (PVR_PIPELINE=2, KOS patch) and fixed 30 fps pacing.
5. UI VRAM diet, so 1.5-2 MiB vertex banks fit.
6. Hardware tuning after the first console session: cache layout, prefetch,
   OC-RAM.

## Controls (done: e024e19, 0a33d0c)

Standard pad:
- Stick, A, B, X, Y, Start, L and R map directly, with the GC PADClamp ranges.
- In free movement the D-pad is camera look, and a short tap of D-pad down is Z (map).
- In scope or binoculars, D-pad up/down zooms.
- In menus, aiming and QTEs the D-pad is the D-pad.

Dual-analog pads use the second stick as the C-stick, and C/Z as Z.

Debug traps (L+Start, Z item-maker) are blocked unless DEBUG_PAD=1.

0a33d0c fixes stick aiming on little-endian targets. Before it, only the D-pad aimed.

The glyph swap is still to do. The 2026-09-26 glyph survey (private catalog `/root/probe/d367-agents/ui-glyphs/CATALOG.md`, mockups in `re4-assets-private/ui-glyphs-20260926`) corrected this line: no Z glyph or Z wording exists, but ONE C-stick glyph is on the route: r101_035.EFF tex 0x89, the binocular ZOOM hint of r101_Event00 (first r101 pass), packaged in every warp fixture set but not in d354v7-fixtures. The C-stick is also named in ss_file #1 msg 4 (Playing Manual 1, camera page) and drawn in the f01e manual picture. The A/B/X/L/R/stick glyphs are in core.das #25 and the ss_map/ss_cmmn/ss_cap hint strips; the map strips and the manual pictures are not packaged on the port today. File-reader text is drawn in one frame (attr 0x40: no typing time), so rewording it cannot move a trace. The look (GC art recoloured vs DC-style buttons), the binocular glyph (D-pad + dual-pad zoom change vs per-pad-kind switch) and the wording are user decisions.

## Route plan (frontier units)

**Milestone 1 disc verified as an r100 disc (2026-09-23, 84fc8ff, canonical README recipe incl. NATIVE_MES, SUBSCREEN_OVL, VMU_SAVE, actor tiers).** Title (2026 art) -> picker (text visible, no backdrop yet) -> intro 1971/2360 frames -> s40 1175/1175 -> radio call (subtitles visible; transceiver video panes blank) -> r100 play (~15 fps Flycast) -> inventory open/close (backing hash ok) -> typewriter save to VMU (RE4DCS01A, 17 blocks). Heap 4 at r100 entry 8,988,032 B; s40 heap 433,824 B; lowest in-play VRAM free 18,632 B. 0 HALT/FAULT/MISSING. **Blocker for r101 (fixed, 9bba3c8):** the east-walk area-block swap (r100_03 ARAM_TO_MRAM) read stale data because the port had no ARAM backing (ARQPostRequest copied nothing). Now GD-ROM stands in for ARAM, with a blocking re-read of the unit file on ARAM_TO_MRAM (same logic tick, STRICT). **r101 first-visit call reset (fixed, 4980a40 + 976c93d, SS_POOL_HIGH=1 in M1):** the effect pools, LightMgr array and primitive buffer are placed above the sub screen's swapped window; the call and the file screen after it now run. **r100 westward reload (fixed, a0c3079, NATIVE_PKG_HIGH=1 in M1):** native packages are carved from the top of heap 4, so FILE_01 reloads after walking back west (area 1: 4 -> 15 fps Flycast, the source fallback is gone). **r101 scenery (W9b landed, 8332a22):** the staged v3 packages are adopted and draw; r101 was then VRAM-bound: its textures were never VQ, because the overlay came from r100 logs only. **Fixed by tex-vq6 (46b9f4f):** the pipeline 00-vq overlay covers r101 (61 images, 4.52 -> 0.69 MB). The square fight runs at 10.1 fps Standard / 9.4 Original in Flycast (test build; was stalled), and Standard vs Original is STRICT. Landed default off, not yet in the recipe: VRAM_PAGES (ea1e2d3; needs hwproject), items 20+21 (9951d17), QUALITY_ASSETS (010169c; r100 proof + hw ms + the 77 KB PT-list decision first). **VRAM:** 161 KB of the r100 gap is a 2 KiB page-alignment pad per texture (KOS pvr_mem in-VRAM headers defeat the page check); page allocator (option A) in progress; a single-bank PVR layout (option C, +1.2-1.5 MB pool, rules out TA_DOUBLEBUF) goes to the user with its fps cost. User trims for Standard VRAM: r101 remaining grove atlases to 8 views + shells 64 VQ; r100 tree atlases re-baked at 8 views.

Assessment: the recovered game reaches r100 gameplay. r101 and r103 have never
run in it; "r101 works" commits are the separate room viewer.

| Unit | Work | Status (2026-09-23) |
|---|---|---|
| W0 | Frozen private baseline | Done (private tree; hashes in frontier notes) |
| W1 | Extract route files from the debug ISO; build r101/r103 DARs; compact em15/26/28/21 | Done: tools ded299f; mirror complete for all 18 route files; em15 resident 3.86 -> 1.14 MB |
| W2 | Register the enemy modules | Patch ready (em15/26/28/21, slot audit). Held: +282 KB image comes out of heap 4, lands with W4 |
| W3 | First r101 entry fixture and measured census | Entered r101, then HALT: heap 4 short (s30 event 2.37 MB; em15 motion keys). Census: room archive 5.47 MB = 62% of heap 4 |
| W4 | Fit r101 memory and VRAM | In progress: ~1.2 MB short after dropping cutscene assets. Levers: event code without cutscene assets, room archive GC-render payload release, em15 hot motion |
| W5 | r100 events | Not started |
| W6 | Door lifecycle: relink-overlap hazard, module .bss reset, ARAlloc reset, KOS headroom | Done (a575a76): r100->r100 relink round trips repeat with 0 heap/VRAM/KOS change; 0 ms. Reload/continue hangs in SndRoomBgmLoad until audio lands (W12) |
| W7 | r101 events with FMV presentation | Working in Flycast: the r120 intro and r100 s40 play as 288x192 PS2 movies with audio; the source effects apply and gameplay continues (c6). Open: only 14-15 of 29.97 fps shown; s03/s20/s30/s41/s43/s44 not yet exercised; 57 KB heap margin during s40 |
| W8 | r101 -> r103 | **W8b-W8e done** (r103 room archive compaction + VQ textures, census, bell -> radio call -> door -> r103: warp-r101-pbdoor4; fixes 17f2aa5 next_room byte order, fee2492 multi-container doorse/bio4midi); W8f natural route and W8g perf next. Was: planned (design-r103/PLAN.md). Transition needs no new systems: bell FMV r101s30.sfd (already staged), the source re-opens the exit, W6 door code. Risks: r103 scenery ~2x r100 (p50 14.2 / worst 30.5 hw ms at 25 m fog); cow-pen worst view ~94 hw ms Original / ~61 Standard before corpses and animals; 10 corpses may need a bit-exact one-pose skin cache; heap 4 fits only with r103 room-archive compaction (+1.1-1.55 MB), VRAM unmeasured. Units: W8a offline fit sheet, W8b archive compaction + W9 release, W8c textures + stream (1,0x33), W8d r103 debug-start census. User decisions 2026-09-23: r103's exit to r106 (not on the disc) fades back to the title on test discs; animals (cows, chickens, dog) get the Ganado Standard treatment once measured; the Standard asset rollout rebuilds r101 and r103 together (done: 49d1e17; sheets published). Later decisions: r101's well (BIN 45) is excluded from house shelling (a landmark in the fight area); r100 uses 128x128 house-shell textures, like r101, to fit its full VRAM pool |
| W9 | r101/r103 scenery packages | Tooling done (`convert_room_bins.py --smd`, `room_smd.py release`, `ps2_trees.py --room`; recipe in `tools/d367/README.md`). Packages: r101 1.27 MB with the PS2 trees, r103 1.39 MB. The release frees 1.59 MB (r101) or 1.55 MB (r103) of GC geometry from the room archive, a net +0.32 MB (r101) of heap 4 after the package. With it, r101 gets past the em15 motion-key HALT and renders in Flycast (evidence `w9-r101-native-released-m2`); the unreleased control still halts. Model estimate (worst view, 70 m fog far): 67-71k strip vertices, 19-25 ms hardware, so over the 10 ms budget; median 7-10 ms. Flycast ms/frame not measured yet: the fixture's present counter stalls in r101 |
| W10 | GDEMU image, disc IO | GDI boot done (93a03e3). MOTION_FAST_READ (a09fd4d): r100->r100 door 24.1 -> 16.0 s on the old recipe. IO_PROBE telemetry + fs_read/fs_open/genwait wraps: on the old recipe the other ~10 s was 63 texture-package fs_opens (~159 ms each, iso9660 rescanning the flat tex directory), which the LFV recipe's TEX_RESIDENT fan-out already removes. LFV + MOTION_FAST_READ: door 6.8 s, of which 2.7 s is 575 misaligned 16 KiB-bounce texture preload reads, 0.9 s source DVD, 0.6 s opens, 0.3 s motion. Hardware-safe design (design-doorload/DESIGN.md): Flycast's door says little about hardware (~2,000 mostly single-sector GD commands, 12.1 MB); estimated today GDEMU 8-17 s, GD-ROM 20-40 s. Queued units: IO_PROBE counters + door summary, TEX_KEEP (textures resident across a room change; Flycast 6.85 -> ~3.4 s), aligned static-mesh reads, DVD wait/reopen fixes; then per-room texture and motion packs, and a GD-ROM disc layout. Target GDEMU ~5-9.5 s. Async/read-ahead and GD-DMA into VRAM rejected. U0 (IO counters) done: the canonical-recipe door is 10.22 s; U1 TEX_KEEP gives 7.2-7.7 s. Confirmed by the user 2026-09-23: the game counts door-load wait frames against wall time, as the original does (it varies with disc speed), so a faster door legitimately shifts the post-door RNG and timers (44 -> 43 frames). That isn't a sequencing change, and door frames are not pinned. Door-speed units prove themselves with a door-equalized arm (a test-only pad to the baseline frame count) that is STRICT over the whole run; a trace pair crossing a door is valid only with matched door frames |
| W11 | Inventory backing and retry | SUBSCREEN=1 landed (8878e3d, le_mirror formats 153dd7b): inventory/transceiver open and close over a saved 3 MiB backing window. Grey-screen root cause fixed: room demand pools (cEm/cParts/cModelInfo/cObj) had headers inside the zeroed window, and EmMgr growth wrote a heap cell into .text; the pools are now frozen at open and thawed at close. SS_POOL_HIGH=1 (2026-09-24, 4980a40 + 976c93d, in M1): allocations the sub screen loop keeps touching are allocated above the window: the effect pools, LightMgr array and primitive buffer. This fixes the r101 call reboot and the type 0x40 file-screen reset. It is STRICT outside the swap interval, and knob-off images are identical. r100 x3 open/close on the m1 recipe + TEX_RESIDENT (w11-ss17-m1-inv3): hashes ok, no HALT, heap 4 and player state identical, ~88 ms/frame before and after; ~1.4 s texture re-preload per close. The .text-change flag was KOS's IRQ temp stack below irq_save_regs (benign, present before any sub screen; w11-ss18-m1-textdiag). Open: ROUTE_MOVIES halt at main.cpp(548) ~3600 vblanks into the r120s00 intro (cause: the 60 s haltExecCheck during long movies, wedging the b50cfa3 YUV path; port-side fix in review). Death/Continue x3 in r100 passes on the m1 recipe (08d51b9 fixture; w11-ss20-m1-die3): heap 4 flat, VRAM 0, BGM restarts, player state identical. Open: r101 death (needs the movie route), VMU save (designed: design-vmu/DESIGN.md; virtual memory card over the VMU, game card.cpp unchanged, LZ4-style saves 16-36 blocks, RE4DCCFG 2, RE4DCSYS 2, test-build RE4DCDBG debug slot saved with L+START and loaded as FILE 20; blocker S0: the typewriter save's ~250 KB data swap halts via re4dc_missing unless it uses W11's VRAM backing; user decisions 2026-09-23: the game's format prompt never formats the VMU, a nearly full VMU overwrites in place, enemy-list delta compression off until real save sizes are measured; implementation S0-S9 started), merchant, r101 inventory, ~175 KB SUBSCREEN image cost |
| W12 | Audio (music and sound effects) | Backend committed (79d3252, AICA_AUDIO=1): GC sequencer + SFX engine on the AICA, ~0.2 ms/frame, fixes the continue hang. Next: offline bank conversion (5.3 s load-time CPU today), fixed per-room AICA layout, st002/st008 streams |
