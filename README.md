# RE4 Dreamcast

**An experimental Resident Evil 4 port for the Sega Dreamcast.**

The recovered GameCube code runs the gameplay, collision and enemy AI. A native PowerVR renderer,
lighter PS2 room assets, streamed movies and VMU saves adapt it to Dreamcast hardware.

## Playing

The latest console test is build `d74b8ec8`. The desktop packages below are the earlier r22j build.
Extract the complete package for your system:

| System | Download | Launch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows (r22j) | [RE4DC-r22j.zip](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/download/play-r22j-audio-performance-20261007/RE4DC-r22j.zip) | Double-click `Play-r22j.cmd`. Includes Flycast and keyboard/DualSense support. |
| Steam Deck / SteamOS (r22j) | [SteamOS package](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/download/play-r22j-audio-performance-20261007/RE4DC-r22j-SteamOS.tar.gz) | In Desktop Mode, run `play.sh`; uses Flathub Flycast. |
| CachyOS / Arch (r22j) | [CachyOS package](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/download/play-r22j-audio-performance-20261007/RE4DC-r22j-CachyOS.tar.gz) | Run `./play.sh`; uses native or Flathub Flycast. |
| Dreamcast / GDEMU | [Console test ZIP](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/download/test-d74b8ec8-20261010/RE4DC-Console-Test-d74b8ec8-20261010-GDEMU.zip) | Copy the four files inside `gdemu` into a new numbered SD card folder. |

[Test build checksums](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/download/test-d74b8ec8-20261010/SHA256SUMS.txt) · [Test notes](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/tag/test-d74b8ec8-20261010) · [r22j desktop checksums](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/download/play-r22j-audio-performance-20261007/SHA256SUMS.txt)

Already have Flycast? Open `gdemu/disc.gdi` from the console test ZIP, keeping all track files beside it.
For an r22j emulator package, open `disc/disc.cue` and keep its `disc.bin` beside it.
For GDEMU, keep filenames unchanged and save any card-manager changes before ejecting the card.
No BIOS or personal VMU saves are included; keep your existing saves separately.

| Action | Dreamcast pad |
| --- | --- |
| Move | Analog stick |
| Aim / fire | Hold R, press A |
| Action / talk / pick up | A |
| Run / cancel | B |
| Knife | L |
| Inventory | Y |
| Pause / options | START |
| Frame pacing: Smooth → Fast → Off | Hold R, press START |

Fast pacing is the default. A VMU in controller slot 1 shows FPS, game speed, CPU percentage and pacing.

## Status and limitations

**Console test `d74b8ec8`, October 10, 2026:** the game plays through the end of the third chapter
(the lake, the boat ride and the lake monster) and into the next one (the wolves on the lake shore),
up to a **Coming Soon** screen. This is a prerelease, not the complete game.

Recent progress:

* Music and voices rebuilt to remove crackling and clipping.
* The lake is drawn as dark water, as on the PS2.
* Safer graphics waits, and an error screen that records what the graphics chip was doing. Console
  photos from players narrowed the bridge door freeze down to one frame the chip never finishes; a fix
  is in progress.
* Look options in testing: the [look test build](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/releases/tag/test-look-630909dd-20261010)
  switches between GameCube style fog, colour and character shading while you play (hold X, press START).

Known issues:

* **Stability:** the [bridge door freeze](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/issues/9) still happens on
  real consoles. [Frozen cutscene video](https://github.com/lamb2k/re4dc/issues/16) is being looked into.
* **Performance:** below the 30 fps/full speed target.
* **Presentation and sound:** some models, effects and textures need work. The music on the third
  chapter results screen is silent. Rifle sound is lower quality.
* **Loading:** room entry pauses remain.

See the [build checklist](port/dreamcast/docs/D367_PLAY_BUILD_CHECKLIST.md) for details.

## Development

The GameCube C/C++ builds for SH-4 with KallistiOS. Dreamcast code replaces graphics, audio, disc and
memory-card services; offline tools convert room worlds, characters and textures from original data.
Game data is not committed. Rendering changes must preserve gameplay, checked with matching logic traces.

Asset work: a PS2 Ganado, the r104 world, button glyphs and a Player's Manual texture before/after VQ compression.
